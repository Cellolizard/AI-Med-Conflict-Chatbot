Laws of Programming: Definition:  A working  program is  one  that has  only unobserved bugs  Laws of Programming: #1  - Every non-trivial program has at least one bug Corollary 1:  A sufficient  condition for program      triviality is that it have no bugs.

Corollary 2:  At least one bug will be observed      after the author leaves the      organization  Laws of Programming: #2  - Bugs will appear in  one part of a working program when another "unrelated" part is modified  Laws of Programming: #3   - The subtlest bugs cause the greatest damage and problems.

Corollary  1: A subtle bug will modify storage thereby masquerading as some other problem  Laws of Programming: #4  - ("Lulled into  security Law") A "debugged" program that crashes will wipe out source files on storage devices when there is the least available backup  Laws of Programming: #5  - A hardware failure will cause system software to crash, and the customer engineer will blame the programmer  Laws of Programming: #6  - A system software crash will cause hardware to act strangely  and  the  programmers   will  blame  the customer engineer  Laws of Programming: #7  - The documented interfaces between standard software modules will have undocumented quirks  Laws of Programming: #8  - The probability of a hardware failure disappearing is inversely proportional to the distance between the computer and the customer engineer  Laws of Programming: #9  - Murphy designed all system software Note: For those  who may be in doubt,  Murphy's Law states that if anything can go  wrong, it will, and always at the most inconvenient time.

Laws of Programming: #10  - (Galvin's Law): Murphy was an optimist  Laws of Programming: #11  - Any given program, when running, is obsolete  Laws of Programming: #12  - If a program is useless, it will have to be documented If a program is useful it will have to be changed  Laws of Programming: #13  - Any program will expand to fill all available memory  Laws of Programming: #14  - The value of a program is proportional to the weight of its output  Laws of Programming: #15  - Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capability of the programmer to maintain it  Laws of Programming: #16  - Make it possible for programmers to write in English and you will find out that programmers cannot write in English  Thoughts on Programming, Number 1: If a programmer is found to be indispensable, the best thing to do is to get rid of him as quickly as possible.

Since  the  first  cave  dweller ventured out to gaze up at the night sky, people have sought to know more about the mysterious images  and lights  seen  there.

Being  limited  by  what could be seen with the unaided eye, that early stargazer relied on intellect and imagination to depict the universe, etching images in stone  by  hand,  measuring and  charting  the  paths  of the wanderers, and becoming as familiar with the sky as the limited technology would allow.

Although stargazers frequently took the wrong paths in attempting  to explain  what  they saw, many of them developed new tools to overcome their limitations.

Galileo crafted a fine telescope for observing the heavens.

His hand-drawn pictures of the satellites  of  Jupiter,  the "cup  handles" of Saturn, and the phases of Venus, when combined with the possible reasons for those facts, shook the very  foundations  of the  European  society  in  the Middle Ages.

Bigger and more powerful telescopes, combined with even newer tools, such as spectroscopes and cameras, have answered most of the the  questions  of  those  ancient stargazers.

But in doing so, they have unfolded even newer mysteries.

Beginning  in  the  1960s, our view of the heavens reached beyond the obscuring atmosphere of Earth as unmanned spacecraft carried  cameras and  other  data  sensors  to probe the satellites and planets of the Solar System.

Images those spacecraft sent back to the Earth provided startling clarity to details that are  only  fuzzy  markings  on  the planets'  surfaces when seen from Earth-based telescopes.

Only two of the presently known planets, Neptune and Pluto, remain unexplored  by our  cameras.

In  August  1989, Voyager 2 will snap several thousand closeup frames of the  planet  Neptune  and  its  largest  satellite, Triton.

By the end of the 20th century, only Pluto will not have been visited by one of our spacecraft.

The knowledge humans have today of outer space would astound Galileo.

Spacecraft  have  sent  back  pictures  of  a  cratered and moon-like surface of the planet Mercury and revealed  circulation  patterns  in the  atmosphere  of  Venus.

From Mars, they have sent back images of craters, giant  canyons,  and  volcanoes  on  the  planet's  surface.

Jupiter's   atmospheric   circulation   has   been  revealed,  active volcanoes on the  Jovian  moon  Io  have  been  shown  erupting,  and previously  unknown  moons and a ring circling the planet discovered.

New moons were found orbiting Saturn and  the  Saturnian  rings  were resolved  in  such  detail  that  over 1,000 concentric ring features became apparent.

At Uranus, Voyager sent back  details  of  a  planet that  is  covered  by  a featureless, bluish-green fog.

The planet is encircled by rings darker than charcoal  and  shaped  by  shepherding satellites,  accompanied  by five large satellites, and immersed in a magnetic field.

Those discoveries, and thousands  of  others  like  them,  were  made possible  through  the  technology  of  telemetry,  the  technique of transmitting data by means of radio  signals  to  distant  locations.

Thus,  the  spacecraft  not  only  carries data sensors but must also carry a telemetry system to convert the data from the various sensors into radio pulses.

These pulses are received by a huge  dish  antenna here  on  Earth.

The  signals  are  relayed  to  data  centers where scientists and engineers can convert the radio pulses back  into  the data the sensors originally measured.

A camera system on board the spacecraft measures reflected light from a planet or satellite as it enters the spacecraft's optical system.

A computer  converts  the  measurements  into numerical data, which are transmitted to  a  receiver  on  Earth  by  radio  waves.

On  Earth, computers reassemble the numbers into a picture.

Because  the  measurements  are taken point by point, the images from space are not considered "true" photographs,  or  what  photographers call  a "continuous tone," but rather a facsimile image composed of a pattern of dots assigned various shades  from  white  to  black.

The facsimile image is much like the halftones newspapers use to recreate photographs.

ŽIf you examine a newspaper photograph with a magnifying glass,  you  will  see  that  is is composed of many small, variously shaded dots.  Even more closely related to the way images are received  from  space is  the  way  a  television  set  works.

For a picture to appear on a television set, a modulated beam of light  rapidly  illuminates  long rows  of tiny dots.

filling in one line then the next until a picture forms.

These dots are called picture elements, or pixels  for  short, and  the  screen  surface  where they are located is called a raster.

Raster scanning refers  to  the  way  the  beam  of  light  hits  the individual  pixels  at  various  intensities to recreate the original picture.

Of course, scanning happens very  fast,  so  it  is  hardly perceptible to the human eye.

Images from space are drawn in much the same manner on a television-like screen (a cathode-ray tube).

Although  cameras  on a spacecraft probing the Solar System have much in common with those in television  studios,  they  also  have  their share  of  differences.

For  one,  the space-bound cameras take much longer to form and transmit an image.

While  this  may  seem  like  a disadvantage,  it  is  not.

The images produced by the slow-scanning cameras are of a much higher quality and contain more than twice  the amount of information present in a television picture.

The  most  enduring  image  gatherer  in space has been the Voyager 2 spacecraft.

Voyager carries a dual television  camera  system,  which can  be  commanded  to  view  an  object  with either a wide-angle or telephoto lens.

The system is mounted on a science platform that  can be  tilted  in any direction for precise aiming.

Reflected light from the  object  enters  the  lenses  and  falls  on  the  surface  of  a selenium-sulfur  vidicon  television  tube,  11 millimeters square.

A shutter in the camera controls the amount of light reaching the  tube and can vary exposure times from 0.005 second for very bright objects to  15  seconds  or  longer  when searching for faint objects such as unknown moons.

The vidicon tube temporarily holds the image on its surface until  it can  be  scanned  for  brightness  levels.

The surface of the tube is divided into 800 parallel lines, each containing 800 pixels, giving a total of 640,000.

As each pixel is  scanned  for  brightness,  it  is assigned a number from 0 to 255.

The  range  (0  to 255) was chosen because it coincides with the most common counting unit in computer systems, a unit called  a  byte.

In computers,  information  is  stored in bits and bytes.

The bit is the most fundamental counting or storage unit, while a byte is  the  most useful  one.

A bit contains one of two possible values, and can best be thought of as a tiny on-off switch on  an  electrical  circuit.

A byte,  on  the  other hand, contains the total value represented by 8 bits.

The value can be interpreted in many ways, such as a  numerical value,  an  alphabet  character  or symbol, or a pixel shaded between black and white.

In a byte, the position of  each  bit  represents  a counting power of 2.

(By convention, bit patterns are read from right to  left.)  Thus,  the  first bit (the righmost bit) of the eight bit sequence represents 2 to the zero power, the second bit refers  to  2 to  the  1 power, and so on.

For each bit in a byte that has a one in it, you add the value of that power of two (the sequence value) until all eight bits are counted.

For example, if the  byte  has  the  bit value of 00101101, then it represents the number 45.

The binary table at  the  end of this document shows how translation of bits and bytes to numbers is done.

If all the bits in an eight-bit  sequence  are  ones,  then  it  will correspond  to  the  value 255.

That is the maximum value that a byte can count to.

Thus, if a byte is used to represent shades of gray  in an  image,  then by convention the lowest value, zero, corresponds to pure black, while the highest value 255, corresponds to  pure  white.

All other values are intermediate shades of gray.

When  the  values  for  all  the  pixels have been assigned, they are either sent directly to a receiver on Earth  or  stored  on  magnetic tape to be sent later.

Data are typically stored on tape on board the spacecraft when the signals are going to be temporarily blocked, such as  when  Voyager  passes  behind  a  planet or a satellite.

For each image, and its total of 640,000 pixels, 5,120,000 bits of  data  must be  transmitted  (640,000  x  8).

When Voyager flew close to Jupiter, data were transmitted back to Earth at a rate of  more  than  100,000 bits  per  second.

This  meant  that  once  data  began reaching the antennas on Earth's surface,  information  for  complete  images  was received in about 1 minute for each transmission.

As  the  distance of the spacecraft from Earth increases, the quality of the radioed data stream decreases and the rate of transmission  of data  has  to  be  slowed  correspondingly.

Thus, at the distance of Uranus, the data has to be transmitted some six to eight times slower than could be done at Jupiter.

That means that only one  picture  can be  transmitted  in  the  time  six  pictures  were taken at Jupiter.

However, for the Uranus encounter, scientists and engineers devised a scheme to get around that limitation.

The  scheme  was  called  data compression.

To  do  that,  they  reprogrammed the spacecraft en route.

Instead of having Voyager transmit the full 8 bits for each pixel, its computers were instructed to send back only the differences between  brightness levels of successive pixels.

That reduced the data bits needed for an image  by  about 60 percent.

Slowing the transmission rate meant that noise did not interfere with the image reception, and by  compressing the data, a full array of striking images was received.

The computers at  NASA's  Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory  (JPL)  restored  the correct brightness  to  each  pixel,  producing  both   black-and-white   and full-color images.

The  radio  signals  that a spacecraft such as Voyager sends to Earth are received by a system of large dish antennas called the Deep Space Network (DSN).

The DSN  is  designed  to  provide  command,  control, tracking  and  data  acquisition  for deep space missions.

Configured around the globe at locations approximately 120  degrees  apart,  DSN provides 24-hour line-of-sight coverage.

Stations  are  located  at  Goldstone,  California,  and near Madrid, Spain, and Canberra,  Australia.

The  DSN,  managed  by  NASA's  Jet Propulsion  Laboratory  in  Pasadena,  California,  consists of three 64-meter  (210-ft)  diameter  dish-shaped  antennas,   six   34-meter (111-ft)  diameter  antennas, and three 26-meter (85-ft) antennas.

As antennas at one  station  lose  contact,  due  to  Earth's  rotation, antennas  at  the next station rotate into view and take over the job of receiving spacecraft data.

While one station is  tracking  a  deep space  mission,  such  as  Voyager,  the  other two are busy tracking spacecraft elsewhere in the sky.

During Voyager's contact with Saturn, the DSN recovered more than  99 percent of th 17,000 images transmitted.

That accomplishment required the  use of a technique known as "antenna arraying." Arraying for the Saturn encounter was accomplished by  electronically  adding  signals received  by two antennas at each site.

Because of the great distance Uranus is from the Earth, the signal received from Voyager 2 was only one-fourth as strong as  the  signal  received  from  Saturn.

A  new arraying  technique,  which  combined signals from four antennas, was used during the Uranus encounter to allow up to 21,600 bits  of  data to be received each second.

Arraying's   biggest  payoff  came  in  Australia,  whose  government provided its Parkes Radio Astronomy Observatory 64-meter  antenna  to be  linked  with  the  DSN's three-antenna complex near Canberra.

The most critical events of the  encounter,  including  Voyager's  closet approaches  to Uranus and its satellites, were designed to occur when the spacecraft would be transmitting to the complex in Australia.

The data were successfully relayed to JPL through that array.

The DSN was able to  track  Voyager's  position  at  Saturn  with  an accuracy of nearly 150 kilometers (about 90 miles) during its closest approach.

This   accuracy  was  achieved  by  using  the  network's radiometric system, the spacecraft's cameras, and a technique  called Very  Long  Baseline  Interferometry,  or  VLBI.

VLBI determines the direction  of  the  spacecraft  by  precisely  measuring  the  slight difference  between  the time of arrival of the signal at two or more ground antennas.

The same technique was used at  Uranus  to  aim  the spacecraft so accurately that the deflection of its trajectory caused by the planet's gravity would sent it on to Neptune.

When  the  DSN  antennas receive the information from the spacecraft, computers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory store it  for  future  use and  reassemble  it into images.

To recreate a picture from data that has been sent across the vacuum of space, computers read the data bit by  bit,  calculating  the  values  for each pixel and converting the value into a small square of light.

The squares are  displayed  on  a television  screen  on  the  spacecraft.

The  resulting  image is a black-and-white facsimile of the object being measured.

Color images can be made by taking three  black-and-white  frames  in succession  and  blending  ("registering") them on one another in the three color-planes of a television screen.

In order for that to work, however, each of the three frames has to be taken by  the  camera  on board the spacecraft through different filters.

On Voyager, one frame is  taken through a blue filter, one through a green, and one through an orange.

Filters have varying effects on the amount of light  being  measured.

For  example,  light passes through a blue filter will favor the blue values in the image  making  them  appear  brighter  or  transparent, whereas  red or orange values will appear much darker than normal.

On Earth the three images  are  given  the  appropriate  colors  of  the filters through which they were measured and then blended together to give a color image.

An  important  feat  the interplanetary spacecraft must accomplish is focusing on its target while  traveling  at  extremely  high  speeds.

Voyager sped past Uranus at more then 40,000 miles an hour.

To get an unblurred  image,  the  cameras  on board had to steadily track their target while the camera shutters were open.

The technique to do this, called  image-motion  compensation,  involves  rotating  the   entire spacecraft  under  the  control  of  the  stabilizing gyroscopes.

The strategy was used successfully both at Saturn's satellite Rhea and at Uranus.

Both  times,   cameras   tracked   their   targets   without interruption.

Once  the  image is reconstructed by computers on Earth, it sometimes happens that objects appear nondescript  or  that  subtle  shades  in planetary  details  such  as  cloudtops cannot be discerned by visual examination alone.

This can be overcome, however, by adding  a  final "contrast  enhancement"  to  the  production.

The process of contrast enhancement is like adjusting the contrast and brightness controls on a television set.

Because the shades of the  image  are  broken  down into   picture  elements,  the  computer  can  increase  of  decrease brightness values of individual pixels,  thereby  exaggerating  their difference and sharpening even the tiniest details.

For  example,  suppose  a  portion  of  an  image returned from space reveals an  area  of  subtle  gray  tones.

Data  from  the  computer indicates  the  range in brightness values is between 98 and 120, and all are fairly evenly distributed.

To the unaided  eye,  the  portion appears  as  a  blurred  gray patch because the shades are too nearly similar to be discerned.

To  eliminate  this  visual  handicap,  the brightness  values  can  be  assigned  new numbers.

The shades can be spread farther apart, say five  shades  apart  rather  than  the  one currently  being  looked  at.

Because the data are already stored on computers, it is a fairly  easy  task  to  isolate  the  twenty-three values and assign them new ones: 98 could be assigned 20, 99 assigned 25,  and so on.

The resulting image is "enhanced" to the unaided eye, while the information is the same accurate data transmitted from  the vicinity of the object in space.

The  past  25 years of space travel and exploration have generated an unprecedented quantity of data from planetary systems.

Images  taken in  space and telemetered back to Earth have greatly aided scientists in formulating better and more accurate theories about the nature and origin of our Solar System.

Data gathered at close  range,  and  from above  the  distorting  effects of Earth's atmosphere, produce images far more detailed than pictures taken by even the largest Earth-bound telescopes.

In our search to understand the world as  well  as  the  universe  in which  we live, we have in one generation reached farther than in any other generation before us.

We  have  overcome  the  limitations  of looking  from  the surface of our planet and have traveled to others.

Whatever yearning drew those first stargazers from  the  security  of their  caves  to  look up at the night sky and wonder still draws men and women to the stars.

"War is a profanity because, let's face it, you've got two opposing sides trying to settle their differences by killing as many of each other as they can."  Which brings us to nuclear weapons...

Since the first test at Alamogordo, our world governments have exploded in total over 2000 of these devices at their bombing ranges (Lop Nor, Kazhakstan, Nevada, Micronesia).

They've done it in the air, on the ground, below the ground, and in the water.

The tests still go on today.

The purpose of this archive is to illuminate to the reader the effects of these nasty devices, and to warn against their use.

At this time, although the threat of a nuclear world war has reduced, there are other threats to our tentative peace which have emerged.

These involve regional conflicts, and the activities of terrorist parties or nations.

They involve issues such as plutonium smuggling, and the sale of weapons technology (possibly clandestine) to militaristic nations.

Continued nuclear testing is also another problem.

It reinforces the position of the London Club nations, and gives incentive to the rest of the world for removing their monopoly.

In fact, this was China's justification for joining the Club.

With Pakistan and North Korea's incipient entry, horizontal proliferation is a tangible threat.

You can expect nations involved in regional conflicts to back their threats up with a nuclear fist if they have one.

If you have a weapon and your survival is threatened, there is a strong chance you will use it in defense, no matter the consequences.

This was the U.S.

Government's justification for the A-bombing of Japan.

It saved the lives of their soldiers.

Little mention was made of Japanese civilians (collateral damage).

The decision to bomb Japan was made in secret.

This led directly to the arms race we are currently involved in.

Russia felt threatened, and embarked on its own bomb program, eventually producing one in 1949.

In turn, the Americans felt threatened, and embarked on the thermonuclear program.

This culminated in the pivotal Mike test of 1952.

Nuclear blackmail during the Korean War led China to make a bomb.

Public disclosure and discussion before Hiroshima would have helped avoid the situation we are in today.

Hence the need for an informed and vigilant worldwide public.

Within the nucleus of a cell are found the chromosomes, long irregular threads of genetic material.

These chromosomes are arranged in pairs: 19 pairs in a cat, 23 pairs in a human.

It is these 38 chromosomes that contain the "blueprint" for the individual cat.

When inspected under a microscope, the chromosomes reveal irregular light and dark bands:  hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions per chromosome.

These light and dark bands are the genes, the actual genetic codes.

Each gene controls a single feature or group of fea- tures in the makeup of the individual.

Many genes interact:  a single feature may be controlled by one, two, or a dozen genes.

This makes the mapping of the genes difficult, and only a few major genes have been mapped out for the cat.

The chromosome is itself composed primarily of the macromolecule DNA, (deoxyribonucleic acid):  one single molecule running the entire length of the chromosome.

DNA is a double helix, like two springs wound within each other.

Each helix is composed of a long chain of alternating phosphate and deoxyribose units, connected helix to helix by ladder-like rungs of four differing purine and pyridamine com- pounds.

It is not the number of differing compounds that provide the secret of DNA's success, but rather the number of rungs in the ladder (uncounted millions) and the order of the amino acids that make up the rungs.

The four different amino acids are arranged in groups of three, form- ing a 64-letter alphabet.

This alphabet is used to compose words of varying length, each of which is a gene (one particular letter is always used to indicate the start of a gene).

Each gene controls the development of a specific characteristic of the lifeform.

There is an all-but-infinite number of possible genes.

As a result, the DNA of a lifeform contains its blueprint, no two alike, and the variety and numbers of possible lifeforms has even today barely begun.

              Mitosis and Mendel  When a cell has absorbed enough of the various amino acids and other compounds necessary, it makes another cell by dividing.

This process is called mitosis, and is fundamental to life.

Not too long ago, it was thought that the chromosomes were generated immediately prior to mitosis, and dissolved away afterwards.

This turned out not to be true.

The extremely tiny chromosomes, normally invisible in an optical microscope, shorten and thicken during mito- sis, becoming visible temporarily.

The rather complex process of mitosis can perhaps be explained simply as a step-by-step process:  Mitosis begins when the cell senses sufficient growth and nutrients to   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Feline Genetics                                                Page 2   support two cells.

The invisible chromosomes duplicate themselves through the wonder of DNA replication.

Various enzymes are used as keys to unlock and unwind the double helix into two single helices.

Each of these he- lices then uses other enzymes to lock the proper parts (the amino acids and other stuff) together to build a new second helix, complete with all transverse rungs, so that the results will be exact replicas of the original double helix.

This winding and unwinding of the DNA can take place at speeds up to 1800 rpm!  The two daughter chromosomes remain joined at a single point, called the centromere.

The cromosomes then wind themselves up, shortening and thickening, making them visible under the microscope, and attach themselves to the nuclear membrane.

The nuclear membrane then dissolves into a fibrous spindle, with at least one fiber passing through each centromere (there are many more fibers than centromeres).

The fibers then stretch and pull the centromeres apart, pulling the chromosomes to opposite sides of the cell.

The spindles dissolve into two new nuclear membranes, one around each group of chromosomes.

The chromosomes unwind back into invisibility, the cell divides, and mitosis is complete.

Genetically, each daughter cell is an exact duplicate of the parent cell.

Since the genetic coding is carried in the rungs of the DNA and only consists of four different materials arranged in groups of three to form words of varying length written with a 64-letter alphabet, the instructions for a "cat" may be considered to consist of two sets of 19 "books," each millions of words long, one set from each of the cat's parents.

The numbers of possible instructions are more than astronomical:  there are far more possible instructions in one single chromosome than there are atoms in the known universe!  A single gene is a group of instructions of some indeterminate length.

Somewhere among all the other codes is a set of instructions composing the "white" gene, and what that set says will determine if the cat is white or non-white.

Since a cat receives two sets of instructions, one from each parent, what happens when one parent says "make the fur white" and the other says "make the fur non-white"?  Will they effect a compromise and make the fur pastel?  No, they will not.

Each and every single gene has at least two levels of expression (many have more), called alleles, which will determine the overall effect.

In the case given, the "make the fur white" allele, "W", is dominant, while the "make the fur non- white" allele, "w", is recessive.

As a result, the fur may be white or non-white, not pastel (we're only speaking of the "white" gene here, a gray cat is caused by an entirely different gene).

The double-dominant "WW" white cat has only white alleles in its white genes.

It is classed as homozygous (same-celled) for white, and will produce only white offspring, regardless of the karyotype of its mate.

The single-dominant "Ww" or "wW" white cat has one of each allele in its white genes.

It is classed as heterozygous (different-celled) for white, and may or may not produce white offspring, depending upon the karyotype of its mate.

The recessive "ww" non-white cat has only non-white alleles in its white genes.

It is classed as homozygous for non-white, and may or may not produce white offspring, depending upon the karyotype of its mate.

Assuming these cats mate, there are sixteen different possible karyo- type combinations.

Since each cat in these sixteen combinations will pass on to their offspring one and only one allele, there are four possible genetic combinations from each mating.

There are sixty-four possible combinations of offspring.

Palpation is a physical exam of the breast.

The doctor examines each breast and underarm by feeling the tissue.

Although a doctor can tell a lot by the way the lump feels, no one can be certain what a lump is just by palpation.

Aspiration, also called fine needle aspiration can help the doctor discover whether the lump is a cyst (fluid-filled) or a solid mass of tissue.

Aspiration is usually done in the doctor's office.

First, the doctor uses a local anesthetic to numb the area.

Then, the doctor inserts a needle into the lump and tries to withdraw fluid.

If it is a cyst, removing the fluid will collapse it.

The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing to be sure no cancer cells are present.

When the lump is solid, the doctor sometimes removes a sample of cells with the needle.

These cells are then sent to a laboratory for analysis.

A mammogram is a type of x-ray that creates an image of the breast on film or paper.

It can help determine whether a lump is benign or cancerous.

In fact, it often can detect cancer in the breast before a lump can be felt.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) suggests that beginning at age 40, all women should have a mammogram every 1 to 2 years.

When a woman reaches 50, she should have a mammogram each year.

A doctor may also recommend a mammogram if any sign or symptom of breast cancer is found, regardless of age.

Several other methods also are being studied.

None is now reliable enough to be used alone, but they may be helpful when combined with other methods.

Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to get an image of the breast and can help determine if a lump is a cyst or a solid mass.

It is usually used along with palpation and mammography.

Diaphanography, or transillumination, shines a light through the breast to show its inner features.

Thermography measures the heat patterns in the breast to produce an image.

A biopsy is the only certain way to learn whether a breast lump or suspicious area seen on a mammogram is cancer.

In a biopsy, the doctor surgically removes all or part of the lump and sends it to the laboratory for analysis.

There are several biopsy methods that a doctor may use: needle biopsy, incisional biopsy, excisional biopsy, and mammographic localization with biopsy.

Occasionally the doctor will do a needle biopsy to remove a small amount of tissue from the lump.

A needle biopsy can be performed in the doctor's office.

This is most often done when cancer is suspected and the doctor hopes to confirm the diagnosis immediately.

If cancer is not found, a more thorough biopsy will follow.

Once, it was thought that inserting a needle or cutting into a breast lump might cause cancer to spread.

This is not true.

An incisional biopsy is the surgical removal of a portion of a lump.

This procedure is often used when the growth is very large.

Again, if no cancer is found, a more thorough biopsy may follow to make sure the entire lump is free of cancer.

In an excisional biopsy the doctor removes the entire lump.

This is currently the "standard" biopsy procedure and the most thorough method of diagnosis.

Incisional and excisional biopsies are usually done in the outpatient department of a hospital.

Either a local or general anesthetic may be used.

Mammographic localization with biopsy (also known as needle localization) is used for suspicious areas such as microcalcifications (tiny specks of calcium) that cannot be felt but can be seen on a mammogram.

During this procedure the breast is x-rayed and small needles are placed to outline the suspicious area for the surgeon who then removes the tissue for biopsy.

This can be done using a local anesthetic in the outpatient department of a hospital.

Your doctor may suggest one or more of these procedures to evaluate a lump or other change in your breast.

The doctor may also suggest watching the suspicious area for a month or two.

Because many lumps are caused by normal hormonal changes, this waiting period may provide additional information.

However, if you feel uncomfortable about waiting, speak with your doctor about your concerns.

You also may want to get a second opinion, perhaps from a breast specialist or surgeon.

Many cities have breast clinics where you can get a second opinion.

The Cancer Information Service also may be able to help you locate doctors to consult.

What will the doctor be able to learn from a biopsy?  The biopsy can tell the doctor whether your lump is benign or malignant.

If it is cancer, your doctor will talk with you about choices of treatments, and you may be advised to get a second opinion.

(You can call the Cancer Information Service for other NCI publications that deal with breast cancer treatment.) If no cancer is found, you may be told that the lump or suspicious area is the result of a fibrocystic condition, fibrocystic disease, benign breast disease, or one of many other conditions.

Remember, 80 percent of all breast lumps are not cancer.

What is a fibrocystic condition, fibrocystic disease, or benign breast disease?  Unfortunately, doctors do not agree on standard terms for benign breast changes.

We prefer to use the term benign breast condition for those changes in a woman's breasts that are not cancerous.

These include normal changes that occur during the menstrual cycle as well as benign lumps that can appear in the breast.

If your doctor uses a different term, or one you do not understand, ask for an explanation.

How many women have a benign breast condition?  It is estimated that at least 50 percent of all women have irregular or "lumpy" breasts.

In addition, many doctors believe that nearly all women have some benign breast changes beginning at age 30.

A woman is more likely to have these breast changes if she has never had children, has had irregular menstrual cycles, has a family history of breast cancer, or is thin.

Women who have had more than one child and women who are taking birth control pills have a reduced risk.

What are the symptoms of a benign breast condition?  Women may have increased "lumpiness" with tenderness, pain, and swelling just before their period begins.

These symptoms lessen after the menstrual period, only to reappear the next month.

Many women find that these symptoms disappear after menopause.

Benign breast lumps may appear at any time.

Some cause pain, others don't.

They may be large or small, soft or rubbery, fluid- filled or solid, and movable.

In addition, some benign breast conditions may produce a discharge from the nipple.

JUST TWO DECADES ago, black holes were an interesting footnote to our astronomical theories that few non-specialists had heard about.

Today, black holes have "arrived" - one hears about them in Hollywood thrillers, in cartoon strips, and more and more on the science pages of your local newspaper.

What exactly are these intriguing cosmic objects and why have they so captured the imagination of astronomers and the public?  A black hole is what remains after the death of a very massive star.

Although stars seem reasonably permanent on human time scales, we know that over the eons all stars will run out of fuel and eventually die.

When smaller stars like our own Sun burn out, they simply shrink under there own weight until they become so compact they cannot be compressed any further.

(This will not happen to the Sun for billions of years, so there is no reason to add a rider to your home owners policy at this time!)  When the largest (most massive) stars have no more fuel left, they have a much more dramatic demise in store for them.

These stars have so much material that they just cannot support themselves once their nuclear fires go out.

Current theories predict that nothing can stop the collapse of these huge stars.	Once they begin to die, whatever remains of them will collapse FOREVER.

As the collapsing star falls in on itself, pull of gravity near its surface will increase.	Eventually its pull will become so great that nothing - not even light - can escape, the star will look BLACK to an outside observer.

And anything you throw into it will never return.

Hence astronomers have dubbed these collapsed stellar corpses "black holes."  Alert readers will quickly note that this expanation of black holes does not bode well for finding one.

How do we detect something that cannot give off any light (or other form of radiation)?  You might suggest that we can spot a black hole as it blocks the light of stars that happens to lie behind it.

That might work if the black hole hovered near the Earth, but for any black holes that are a respectful distance away in space, the part of the sky it would cover would be so small as to be invisible.

To make matters worse, the sort of black hole that forms from a single collapsing star would be only 10 or 20 miles across - totally insignificant in size compared to most objects astronomers study and much too small to help a distant black hole hunter on Earth.

The size of a black hole, by the way, is not the size of the collapsing star remnant.

The stuff of the former star does continue to collapse forever inside the black hole.

What gives the hole its "size" is a special zone around the star's collapsing core, called the "event horizon." If you are outside this zone, and you have a powerfull rocket, you still have a chance to get away.

Once you passed inside this zone, the gravitational pull of the collapsing stuff is so great, nothing you can do can help you from being pulled inexorably to your doom.

The name "event horizon" comes from the fact that once objects are inside the zone, events that happen to them can no longer be communicated to the outside world.

It is as if a tight "horizon" has been wrapped around the star.

How then could we detect these bizzare objects and verify the strange things predicted about them?  It turns out that far away from a black hole the only way to detect it is to "watch it eating."  If a black hole forms in a single star system, there is very little material close to the collapsed remnant for its enormous gravity to pull in.

But we believe that more than half of the stars form in double, triple or multiple systems.

When two stars orbit each other in proximity, and one becomes a black hole, the other one may have some difficult times ahead.

Under the right circumstances, material from the outer regions of the normal star will begin to flow toward its black hole companion.

As particles of this stolen material are pulled into a twisting, whirling stream around the black hole's event horizon, they are heated to enormous temperatures.

They quickly become so hot that they glow - not just with visable light, but with far more energetic X-rays.

(Of course, all this can be seen only above the event horizon; once the material falls into the horizon, we have no way of ever seeing it again.)  Astronomers began searching in the 1970s for the tell-tale X-rays that indicate that a black hole is consuming a part of its neighbor star.

Since cosmic X-rays are blocked by the Earth's atmosphere, these observations became possible only when we could launch sensitive X-ray telescopes into space.

But in the last decade and a half, at least three excellent candidates for a "feeding" black hole have been identified.

Probably the best-known case is called Cygnus X-1, a system in the constellation of Cygnus the swan, in which we see a normal star that appears to be going around a region of space with nothing visable in it.

Smack dab from the middle of that region, we see just the sort of X-rays that reveal the stream of material being sucked into the hole.

While this sort of indirect evidence is not quite as satisfying as seeing a black hole "up close," for now (and perhaps fortunately) it will have to do.

What is intriguing astronomers these days is the posibility that enormous black holes may have formed in crowded regions of space.

These may not just eat part of a companion star, but may actually consume many of their neighbor stars eventually.

What we would then have is an even larger black hole, able to eat even more of the material in its immediate neighborhood.

In the most populated areas of a galaxy - for example, its center - black holes may ultimately form that contain the material of a million or billion stars.	In recent years, astronomers have begun to see tantalizing evidence from the center of our own galaxy and from violent galaxies in the distant reaches of space indicating that such supermassive black holes may be more common than we ever imagined.

If this evidence is further confirmed, we may find that the strange black hole plays an important role not only in the death of a few stars but even in the way entire galaxies of stars evolve.

Prologue:  Before launching into the body of this article, there are a few things that I want to set straight.

First, those who dislike films are advised to re-read the title.

To the best of my knowledge, a good number of science fiction buffs, myself included, moonlight as film fans.

I've had enough experience though with all of the various subgenres within the sf/horror field to know that there may be many polar opposites, and I don't expect everyone to be into films.	It is to those readers who find cinema more bearable than fingernails on a blackboard, and most of all for my own pleasure, that this article is written.

As a footnote, those who dislike film "fans" and look down at buffs of that or any other entertainment medium, earn somewhat less respect from yours truly.

(The same principle applies to film buffs with a similar snobbish attitude toward nonfilm buffs.) I can better understand opposition to all vicarious imitations of life than I can to one specific type.

In my opinion, matters of private taste cannot legitimately be represented as dogma without exposing the proponent as a pompous fool.

Any door that fails to swing both ways is nothing more than a sham.

Second, while all of the films reviewed here in capsule form are available to television there isn't a "made-for-TV" picture in the lot.

Everything here received some, if in many cases very limited, theatrical distribution.	The thoughts expressed reflect nothing more concrete than my own subjective impressions.

I also want to stress that the "standards" employed are those observed during more casual viewings such as on television.

Entertainment value, except that provided by unintentional camp, has most definitely been taken into consideration.

This may appear self-evident, but a handful of self-styled "Film Scholars" look down on this approach.

In one sense, the following collection was compiled at random, but in another, the structure is deceptively formal.

My avoidance of over-publicized titles is deliberate.

Many of the best---and many of the worst---films in the genre have been exposed to the point of absolutely indelible deja-vu.

You will find no signs of Bride of Frankenstein, Night of the Living Dead, Alien or King Kong (the first version) here.	Neither, granting equal time for the same reason, will you be forced to encounter the movies over-exposed due to their "lack" of quality such as Plan Nine From Outer Space, Robot Monster, Bride of the Monster, and Cat Women of the Moon.) Sitting through films of this prestigious nature may offer greater promise of satisfaction, but if I read one more word about them, I'll scream!  As a result of my efforts to bypass monotony, the majority of those films I've chosen to cover are relatively obscure, even among circles of horror/sf/fantasy film fans.

As a further result, most are ultra-low budget (not necessarily a pejorative), shoe-string and independent productions that ended up being distributed to quickie first-run openings, the drive-in circuit, kiddies' matinees and all-night flophouses, if at all.

Even on the tube, treatment is shabby; these are more likely run as late night second features and specialty shows than on the networks (although, ironically, that's where two on this list debute TV-wise).

The names at the end of each capsule review are those of the lead players; the country at the opening denotes the origin.

+  +  +  The Astro-Zombies (USA, 1971).

The title gives us an accurate picture.

Mindless, amateurish mishmash of pseudo-horror and espionage as operatives of "both" sides compete for a mad doctor's reanimation device.

Neither seems particularly concerned that the "zombies" automatically engage in murderous rampages, and we, the audience, aren't given any clear indication of the motives behind such anti-social behaviour other than that the reanimated corpses are instantly struck with a compulsion to kill females.

(The "mad scientist," incidentally, is aided by a traditionally hunchbacked lab assistant, while an ever present and unidentified woman spends the entire picture strapped to a table, periodically screaming and fainting, but serving no apparent purpose other than the titillation of kinkier viewers.) Absurdist trash might be tolerated by the kiddies, but it's doubtful that anyone else will go for it.

Even the laughs, and they do exist to a limited extent, aren't enough to prevent the itches from attacking.

Tom Pace, Joan Patrick, John Carradine, Wendall Corey, Rafael Campes, Victor Izay.

Boy Who Cried Werewolf (USA, 1973) This lightweight mediocrity reminiscent of the slightly more palatable 50's quickies is no great shakes, but does relatively well considering the extent of potentially lethal drawbacks facing it.

(For example, the incredibly unconvincing "make-up" closely resembling a second-rate Halloween costume, laughably hammy acting by the person behind the obvious mask, the cornball equation of "hippy" and "Jesus" movements, the intrusion of exceptionally bad comedy relief and some stereotypic soap opera exchanged between the film's love interests.) A man is turned into Werewolf by a lycanthropy bite received during a wilderness trip and is discovered by his prepubescent son whose vain attempts to convince others that his findings are more than flights of fancy justify the title.

Merely fair (and then only by grade "B" standards), yet still a miniature cut above its economic counterparts, but leaves little, if any after taste.

Not worth going out of one's way to see, and probably won't make a powerful enough impression to be remembered on anyone's "ten worst" list, but at least it shouldn't agonize shut-ins.

Scott Sealey, Kerwin Matthews, Elaine Devry, Bob Hommel, Robert J Wilke, Susan Foster.

Cave of the Living Dead (Germany, 1962) Atrociously dubbed and talky, plodding and chiefly uneventful crud effort at combining espionage and horror.

The secret agent investigating mass murders suspected to be of a cloak and dagger nature learns that they were actually committed by a colony of modern day vampires.

Dullsville incarnate.

Health and Welfare should attach a warning to this one.

Carl Mohner, Adrian Hoven, John Kitzmiller, Wolfgang Priess.

Creature With the Blue Hand (Germany, 1969) Another in the string of oddball crime films Germans are so fond of labelling "horror." Most are released directly to TV in this country, although this one was an exception, having been distributed with the Phillipines-shot Beast of the Yellow Night.

This badly dubbed murder mystery with horror overtones tells of an innocent man wrongly convicted of being a costumed mass murderer (the uniform's glove is blue; hence the title, which is an example of limb climbing if I've ever seen it) who escapes prison intent on establishing innocence by (literally) unmasking the true culprit.

No better and no worse than others of its ilk; about average, in fact, but in light of the field's general condition, I see no reason to torture oneself.

Harold Leipnitz, Klaus Kinski, Diana Koerning, Carl Lange.

Equinox (USA, 1968) An amateur film, which was rewarded with (limited) commercial release after being screened by poverty-row distributors, shows it's home movie origins (except in the surprisingly good special effects and the talented script) and for that reason alone may be unfairly condemned without a trial by purists and pseudo-intellectuals, but if so, it's their loss.

Redeemed by a consistently bizarre atmosphere, this is no unforgettable classic, but it is several cuts above the average "cheapie." College students come up against satanic forces while searching for a professor (Fritz Leiber in a brief but pivotal role) who disappeared while investigating the occult in a rural site.

The script consistently alternates the refreshingly plausible (as grade B horror films go) and the outrageous.

This film was more impressive at the release date, before screen depictions of Satan and his minions had grown commonplace.

Edward Connel, Barbara Hewitt.

Frankenstein's Bloody Terror (Spain, 1968) Ohmigod!  Most foreign cheapies are pretty bad, yes, but this utterly brainless garbage, apparently designed with grade-schoolers intentionally in mind, makes the others look good.

Most imports suffer from tawdry American treatment (bad dubbing, editing, etc.) and while this is no exception, it looks as if it were miserable to begin with.

Unfortunate viewers will wonder what the title has to do with the content if they miss the brief (and probably tacked on by US distributors) explanation that the Frankenstein clan changed it's name somewhere along the line to "Wolfstein" and were cursed with lycanthropy as punishment for the Baron's crimes.

Yeah, sure.

Worse yet, the miasmic plot concentrates on an unrelated man turned into a werewolf by a bite from (you guessed) it) Wolfstein.	Further complicating this topsy-turvy mess, his efforts to find a cure lead to his unwitting involvement with a vampire pair posing as professional exorcists to secure a steady stream of victims.

Unsurpassed idiocy.

Among the screen's darkest moments.

The extremely tacky look that leaves no question about the picture's financial status compounds my amazement that this one ever made it to other shores.

Paul Naschy (the Spanish John Belushi), Diana Zura, Mike Manza, Gilbert Granger, Anita Avery.

The Fury (Usa, 1978) Poor old Brian DePalma temporarily lived down his positive reputation with this tedious hokum, as bad as most of the worst "C" cheapies, but without the excuse of a shoestring budget to make it more tolerable.

A muddled fantasy-horror-espionage combination where, following the abduction of his telekinetic son, a former spy sets out to crush an unscrupulous cloak and dagger outfit utilizing paranormal secret weapons.

No sense of enthusiasm is radiated, although it is to be assumed that at least a smidgen was involved.

This vapid absurdity is dull enough that the potential for camp is rarely realized.

Kirk Douglas, Amy Irving, Carrie Snodgrass, John Casavettes, Charles During, Carol Rossen, Andrew Stevens.

Invasion From Inner Earth (Canada, 1974) Markedly shoddy physical appearance, an indicator of the virtually nonexistent budget is transcended by stress-building tension and a weird atmosphere in an eerie Night of the Living Dead imitation.

Travelers stranded in a strangely deserted rural Manitoba encounter aggressive emissaries of a subterranean race.

Attention to a "hollow Earth" theory and a brooding sense of doom dominates this cheap but creepy little yarn.

Certain elements, like the theft of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly theme song are better left ignored.

This film is no classic, but has more to offer than it initially leads us to believe.

Slightly more competent acting than traditionally associated with these ultra-cheapies comes in handy.

Paul Bentzen, Debbie Pick, Nick Holt, Karl Wallace.

Let's Scare Jessica to Death (USA, 1971) Regarded as a "mini-sleeper" by some, this uneven shocker does indeed posses isolated moments, but they are too far between to sustain closer examination.

A string of film clips might have been more effective...	A former mental patient and her husband move to a small town inhabited by vampires.

Her observations are, of course, taken as symptomatic of mental illness.	The moderately unexciting script could benefit from a more stable flow of events.

This one has potential, but is skittish.

Zhora Lampert, Kevin O'Conner, Barton Heyward, Gretchen Corbett, Mark Claire-Costello.

Lost Continent (UK, 1969) (This is not to be confused with the earlier "dinosaur" film of the same name.) This painfully juvenile film adaptation of Denis Wheatley's Uncharted Island might satisfy the youngsters, but it is unsuitable fare for anyone else.

In a Victorian setting, sea-going smugglers and their unwary passengers are stranded in unfamiliar territory where they run into monsters and a hostile civilization.

Nothing much happens, which means that Wheatley's novel must not have been followed very closely.

This is not just a bad Hammer film, but a bad film period, and not at all what we've come to expect from the England.

Eric Porter, Hildegare Neff, Tony Beckley, Nigel Stock, Suzannah Leigh.

Man Who Haunted Himself (UK, 1970) Imaginative, and stylish, if somewhat prolix, novelty.

As the title implies, an executive recently discharged from the hospital is jeopardized by his unscrupulous double.

No Citizen Kane, but this obscure, almost unknown sf movie should be seen by those who insist that the field has never produced anything of worth.

The "surprise" ending, previously used in another picture is predictable, but what the heck.

Viewers who didn't see the antecedent might be impressed.

Roger Moore, Hildegarde Neil (not Neff), Anton Rogers, Olga Georges-Picon, Thorley Waters, Alastair MacKenzie.

Man With the Icy Eyes (Italy/USA, 1971) This inept crime/melodrama/mystery with almost incidental supernatural overtones isn't as inspired as some in the foreign-cheapie category, and never attains more than run-of-the-mill stature.

Likewise, the uneven dubbing isn't uniformly bad, but just obvious enough to let us know that it wasn't shot in Hollywood.

A newspaper is menaced by elements of both mortal and occult origin while trying to vindicate an erroneously convicted assassin.

The obvious efforts at trying to generate suspense fail.	Fair as late night TV features go, an evaluation which you may interpret as you like.	Antonio Sabato, Barbara Bouchet, Victor Buono, Keenan Wynn.

People That Time Forgot (UK - USA, 1977) The dinosaurs are more convincing than the virtually catatonic lead player, although the supporting cast is adequate at light work.

If one is able to ignore Patrick Wayne's wooden performance and some of the uproariously sexist dialogue (causing one to wonder if this is what the title refers to), this so-so film version of E R B's novel is one of the more palatable of the special kiddie matinee-oriented fantasy adventures.

A search party hunting a missing war hero in the Antarctic discover a "lost" tropical area populated by prehistoric beasts, warring tribesmen, and the obligatory volcano.	No new ground is broken, but the execution is somewhat above the average lost world opus.

The inconsistent special effects alternate between the exemplary and the poor.

This innocuous froth holds little for anyone past puberty, but if you can recall your younger days, it's not too bad.

Beside Wayne, principals include Sarah Douglas, Thorley Waters, Dana Gillespie, Doug McClure.

S-S-S-S (USA, 1973) Almost no atmosphere or suspense, but a mildly diverting script and a lack of pretension make up for it.

An unwitting college student is subjected to experiments by a typically deranged serum researcher intent on solving our problems by creating a snake-Homo Sapiens hybrid.

A fun film, with a healthy sense of vitality, this one is raised from being another juvenile "monster-on- the-loose" picture by not taking itself too seriously.

The tounge-in-cheek approach plays it straight for the kiddies, and as near-satire for adults.

Strother Martin, Dirk Benedict, Heather Menzies, Jack Gina, Richard B Shull.

Stanley (USA, 1970) This one seems indecisive about whether it wants to be psychological horror, action-adventure, mild crime, or an "anti- establishment youth cult" film.

It compromises in nearly episodic fashion, and as a result, fails miserably in each department.

The first half, straight adventure, focusing on a defender-of- wildlife Vietnam veteran (who happens to be a native American) who skirmishes with a band of villainous hunters is just typical haphazard cheap film fare.

It goes progressively downhill in the second half where he abruptly transforms into a homicidal maniac using snakes as a murder weapons.

The one- dimensional nature is emphasized by the film's pretension of "making a statement".

Unbelievable finale.

Chris Robinson, Susan Carole, Alex Rocco, Steve Alaimo.

Teenage Zombies (USA, 1960) When players actually speak lines like "eck" and "ugh", you know what to expect.

Incredibly bad, outrageously amateurish, substandard by even home movie standards, this is representative of the era ostentatiously oriented toward adolescents, but aimed more at prepubescent minds.	This is a downright embarassment, wherein teenage castaways on a tropical island become the target of a female mad scientist employed by "the Enemy" to conduct mind control experiments.

The plot to turn the good guys into mindless vegetables is foiled, of course, but the calibre of acting talen makes one wonder.

The bulk of monster antics are supplied by the obligatory and homicidal lab assistant.

One of the all-time worst, this falls short of approaching it's own unique form of high art.

You won't quite believe the stupidity unraveling before your eyes.	Don Sullivan, Katherine Victor, Steve Conte.

Thin Air (UK, 1968, aka The Body Stealers) The tepid script condemns well-made sf/super/spy concoction to mediocrity.

The government agent assigned to investigate disappearances of key military personnel discovers that they were abducted by hostile aliens.

Moderately dreary, but quickly forgotten.

Patrick Allen, Lorna Velda, George Saunders, Hillary Dwyer, Maurice Evans, Neil Connery, Allan Cuthbertson.

Tower of Terror (UK, 1971) Not much atmosphere, and only a tad more suspense, a fairly enjoyable psychoshocker/mystery/-suspense yarn.

As two of the most vital ingredients in the film are left dangling (although continuity appears intact in all other departments), it seems likely that this film suffered unwise editing.

A co-ed turns amateur sleuth to avenge the victimization of a close friend by the rapist-murderer plaguing the campus.

Not up to the level of most UK thrillers, but a cut above the average American cheapie, it lies somewhere in between.

Suzy Kendall, Frank Finley, James Laurenson, James Donald.

The Twisted Brain (USA, 1974, alternate title, Horror High) Fantastically predictable but somehow mildly entertaining formula cheapie (due to competent acting), a downtrodden (and conventionally milquetoast) student is afflicted with chemically- induced split personality and goes on to wipe out his enemies while under the influence of his alter ego.

Heavily flawed, but acceptable on it's own shoddy terms.

Trashy, but for the lenient, amiable.

Pat Cardi, Rose Holotik, Austin Stoker, John Niland.

Valley of Gwangi (USA, 1969) The prestigious Ray Harryhausen special effects can't hide the fact that every cliche in the books is used here, and the story is a welfare recipient's rehash of King Kong.

This extremely poor combination monster tale and trite western is recommended only for the most insistent completist.

A Wild West Show inadvertantly discovers a prehistoric valley.

After the predictable shenanagins take place, a dinosaur is captured, exhibited, and breaks loose, causing all manner of havoc.

Sound familiar?  In more ways than one, it is.

Unfortunately, the pathos element that made the forerunner work is conspicuously absent.

The merit of the visuals can't salvage the lame, anemic, lacklustre and quite tiresome screenplay.

Really plastic.

James Franciscus, Gilda Golan, Richard Carlson, Lawrence Naismith, Curtis Arden.

"Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged ina great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.

We are met on a great bat- tlefield of that war.

We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.

It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.

The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.

The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.

It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.

It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth."  When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.

But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.

The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.

To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.

He has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation:  For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:  For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:  For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:  For imposing taxes on us without our Consent:  For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:  For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:  For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:  For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:  For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms:  Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.

A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free People.

Nor have We been wanting in attention to our British brethren.

We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.

We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.

We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.

They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.

We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.

And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

We the people of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

WASHINGTON-- Presid.

and deputy from Virginia  The food tables and data methods based on "EATER'S CHOICE: PATIENT GUIDE" are the guidelines of the American Heart Association.

The key to the plan is controlling your intake of the nutrient that most affects blood cholesterol levels - saturated fat.

Saturated Fat:  Fats contain a mixture of fatty acids - saturated, monosaturated, and polyunsaturated.

Animal fats contain a greater proportion of saturated fatty acids, which raise blood cholesterol levels; vegetable oils usually contain a greater proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which lower blood cholesterol levels.

The more saturated the fat, the more solid it is at room temperature.

Examples of saturated fat include beef fat, butter, lard, shortening, coconut oil, and chocolate.

Figuring your Daily Allowance of Saturated Fat:  The Heart Association recommends that no more than 10% of your total calories come from saturated fat.

Translating Your Saturated Fat Quota Into Foods:  Keep track of the foods you eat during the day, along with their saturated fat calories.

Limit your saturated fat intake to the 10% level calculated.

You may want to begin by determining which foods your saturated fat calories are coming from.

You can then decide which foods to cut back on or eliminate to lower your saturated fat intake.

Food tables will also help you choose foods low in saturated fat to substitute for foods high in saturated fat.

Controlling Dietary Cholesterol and Other Fats:  Dietary cholesterol can be controlled by simply eliminating the few high cholesterol foods ( egg yolks, organ meats, sardines, and shrimp).

Substituting polyunsaturated margarines and oils for butter and shortening will give you adequate polyunsaturated fat.

Here is a recipe with my personal preferences for what to put in it, but you can add or substitute anything which happens to suit your fancy, such as fresh mushrooms, chickpeas, etc.

In Silicon Valley some of the country's best computer hackers are talking about acts of civil disobedience in cyberspace.

Their target is a plan by the Federal Government to discourage a proliferation coding schemes that insure electronic conversations are private - from everyone including the authorities.

Under a plan being pushed by the Clinton Administation, the computer industry would be strongly encouraged to adopt a new data scrambling standard, embodied in a device called the Clipper Chip, that would allow law enforcement agencies, armed with the court orders, to eavesdrop on electronic communications.

Earlier this month, Vice President Al Gore said the proposed standard was an important law and order issue for the Administration.

The danger, he warned, is that unchecked computer coding technology will make it possible for terrorists and criminals to have secret electronic conversations.

The White House is also pressing for legislation that would require telephone networks, cable companies and wireless communications services to install systems that allow law enforcers to listen in...

While the Clipper system is voluntary today, a coalition of Silicon Valley business executives and civil liberties advocates argues that there is no guarentee that it won't be mandatory by a future Administration.

In the meantime, it could become a de facto standard as companies that want to do Government business would have to install the chips in their products.

Furthermore the Government could use existing export laws to require Clipper chips in any computers shipped to other countries.

"They're asking us to ship millions of computers abroad with a chip stamped J.

Edgar Hoover inside," said John Gage, director of the science office at the Sun Microsystems Inc., a maker of computer work stations based in Moutain View, Calif, "We refuse to do it." A Silicon Valley group called Cypherpunks, which wants to make free and powerful cryptography avaliable to the masses, has been discussing ways to trick officials into thinking the keys to the Clipper code have been stolen.

Others are considering violating export restriction laws by sending thousands of copies of encoding software out of the country over the Internet.

In fact, the ability to devise coding schemes - unbreakable even by the most powerful supercomputers - is so widespread that trying to impose a unviersal standard may be like trying to enforce Prohibition.

Home-brew coding software can be easily exported by electronic runrunners on computer disks or instantly sent over electronic networks to any city in the world.

With Clipper, which was developed by the National Security Agency, communications are mathematically scrambled with an unbreakable code, but an extra set of two keys - actually long numbers - would permit authorized third parties to listen in, with the same restrictions that now apply to wiretapping.

As a safeguard, both keys would be required to minitor conversations.

But some opponents argue that the system could still be abused by Government officals or clever hackers who are able to steal the code.

They also point out that despite claims that the Clipper is necessary for national security, no other foreign Government or foreign company has indicated that it is willing to use a coding system that is breakable by the United Sates spying agencies.

Even close allies like Canada and Britian have said that they are not willing to adopt Clipper.

Last week, Michael Nelson, an Administration offical in charge of technology policy, broadcast an electronic mail message over the Internet to reassure computer users that the Government has no intention of enforcing mandatory encrytion.

But skeptics remain unpersuaded.

"They are utterly transfixed with the horrible vision of the nuclear armed terrorist," said John Perry  Barlow, a founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a public interest computer group that is campaigning to stop the Clipper chip.

"This is the last ditch effort of the old superpowers trying to establish imperial control over Cyberspace." Across the Internet, activists aren't waiting for the Government to back down.

They're pressing ahead with their own coding software and disseminating it over the networks.

A programmer named Philip Zimmerman has written free software called Pretty Good Privacy for protecting electronic mail messages.

The program touched off a Justice Department investigation  after it was sent overseas through international networks.

Now Mr.

Zimmerman is working on another free program that will allow personal computers, equipped with microphones, speakers and conventional high-speed modems, to act as secure telephones, allowing their users to have private conversations that can't be overheard.

This promises to be about as popular with Clipper supporters as radar detectors are will the highway patrol.

Have you made your New Year's Resolutions yet? I haven't, but then again, I NEVER make them, so nothing has changed [grin].

Well, Congress has never made any New Year's resolutions before, either.

But I plan to change that.

My article this month is a list of resolutions -I- think Congress needs to make.

First and foremost: Fiscal responsibility.

My number one complaint with Congress is that it doesn't know how to keep a balanced budget OR how to keep from increasing spending.

It's high time we saw drastic cuts in governmental programs.

Welfare is the best place to cut.

The Republicans are claiming they will be reforming welfare.

Guys, I've got news for you: Welfare doesn't need reform.

It needs elimination.

The Republicans are also working on a Balanced Budget Amendment.

EXCELLENT! If they can pull this off, Congress will begin to come back to a more beneficial state for the people.

Second, take a stance on important issues and make some policy.

The issue of gays in the military is a prime example of the flip-flop of Congress and the Executive branch.

Either allow them or disallow them.

Make up your mind what you are going to do.

This type of stance will make big enemies, but equitable compromise is not going to be reached.

The one exception to this would be abortion.

This is a moral issue, and not the government's responsibility.

Government funding to abortion clinics should cease, and let the other abortion-related issues settle themselves out.

But besides that, it is time for Congress to tell the people what they have decided to do.

No more waffling.

Third, work together with the other two branches of government.

Mostly this applies to the Presidency, but to a lesser degree, also the Judicial branch.

Gridlock, we all know, is something that has existed forever.

I am not suggesting an end to gridlock.

Gridlock can be very good.

But the government needs to go out, see what the people of America want, and work together to do it.

If it means tax cuts, then cut the taxes.

Tax money does NOT belong to the government.

If the people want a cut, GIVE IT TO THEM.

Make up for it by taking out wasteful programs, like welfare.

Finally, destroy the civil-help programs, including welfare, medicaid, medicare, and other bureaucracies.

Government is for the express purpose of governing.

We are paying them to make laws, enforce them, keep them in line with the Constitution, and defend our country from enemy nations.

When they begin intruding into the private sectors, offering hand-outs, making promises to cure social ills, and trying to be our big brother, they make a mess.

Government has NEVER successfully instituted a social program that was successful in elimintating the poor and homelessness problems, or curing the social/family ills of a nation.

NEVER.

So stop trying, please.

I am paying you to govern, not to patronize.

Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich calls public broadcasting the "media of the elite", and subsequently wants federal funding for it to be eliminated.

Both the label and the proposal are preposterous; they are the fingerprint of the Gingrich Regime: silly and unjustified.

First, the label.

Gingrich considers CNN and C-Span, the cable network's answer to public broadcasting's educational programs, the real arena of action.

He believes that public broadcasting is, as cited before, "the media of the elite".

Anyone who thinks it over will realize that his labels are simply untrue.

Public broadcasting is free, and anyone can use it.

It features programs that appeal to children and adults, liberals and conservatives, and men and women.

A wide, diverse cross-section of America uses public broadcasting, and appreciates it tremendously.

Anyone can tap into public broadcasting's vast expanse of information, and many people do.

On the other hand, consider cable television.

CNN and C-Span, while certainly worthwhile stations, come with a price tag attached.

They do not reach the rural parts of the country.

In fact, about 40 percent of the country does not receive cable.

Calling public broadcasting the "media of the elite" is an outrage and an insult to anyone who grew up watching Sesame Street and Mr.

Roger's Neighborhood.

It is a complete hypocrisy; it is parallel to calling a homeless man an "elitist", and labeling a wealthy aristocrat a working-class American.

Next, the merits of public broadcasting over cable television.

Public broadcasting is, bar none, the crown jewels of the media.

It provides high-quality, educational programming, such as "Sesame Street", for children, or, as a local example, "Donnybrook", for adults.

The programs stimulate thought and creativity; they inform viewers about the issues of the day.

Public broadcasting is cheap for taxpayers: each resident of the country pays only twenty-nine cents per year.

And, finally, and most importantly, anyone can access public broadcasting, regardless of their social status: public broadcasting is free.

Public broadcasting is an excellent example of public and private sector cooperation.

In stark contrast, cable television does not surpass public broadcasting in any way.

Far from it: cable television represents the worst that media can be.

The cable alternative is one of extreme violence, inexcusable language, and extremely immoral adult scenes.

Conservatives, who despise this programming and cry that it is eroding our morals, must remember that destroying public television will leave only the immoral contents of cable television to entertain children and adults alike.

Furthermore, cable television cannot and never will reach everyone.

It is far too expensive for cable companies to reach rural areas, and cable television will always cost a monthly bill.

Therefore, only well-off suburban or urban residents can access cable, leaving the rural viewers and the poor out in the dark.

Eliminating governmental funding from public broadcasting will certainly destory a number of public television stations, and seriously cripple many others.

Many rural stations will certainly fall almost immediately.

Others will only barely manage to provide their services.

Meanwhile, urban stations will suffer as well.

While most will not immediately cut off services, almost all will certainly have to decrease the quality of their programming to compensate for the lost funds.

Meanwhile, taxpayers will not feel the difference in their pockets.

While millions of federal dollars might seem an incredible burden, it would not be enough to significantly decrease the deficit, or pay for any substantial tax decreases.

Taxpayers will hurt if federal funds are recalled.

Their children will not have access to shows like "Sesame Street", that teach the kind of morals that adults would be proud of.

Their children would be subject to the mercy of ruthless cable television, the source of many horrible programs.

Taxpayers themselves would no longer benifit from interesting and intelligent news shows, such as the McNeil-Lehrer News Hour.

They could no longer rely on the unparalleled news analysis of the MacLaughlin Group or Donnybrook.

No taxpayer would have the advantage of waking up each morning to National Public Radio's morning show.

Again, adults would have to rely on commercial television to replace public broadcasting, which it could not do.

Public broadcasting is a boon to everyone.

It is the best example of working, effective, government cooperation with the private sector.

It costs taxpayers almost nothing, yet public broadcasting educates, stimulates, and entertains viewers.

Government could not provide us with a better service for a lower price, and we would be ill advised to eliminate it.

To even consider replacing public television with cable is the most outragoues and ludicrous notion ever considered.

It should be swiftly and resoundingly rejected by the Congress.

I was asked to write a small article about our 1995 plans at POM.

Well, I'll do just that, but please bear in mind, these are just plans, and nothing has been finalized.

Number one on our agenda is this: Getting more writers.

A magazine can not be good without content.

And right now, we are suffering, and we are suffering drastically.

We are scowering every place imaginable, looking for articles to put into POM, like the excerpted article "The Two Party System Myth" this month.

If you would like to write, please contact us, using the information at the end of the magazine.

When we -do- have enough writers, we will get the Political Chat Match up and running every month.

The Match is an online debate that we capture and then place into POM each month.

We had planned to do the Match from the very beginning, but a lack of dedicated writers thus far has prevented us from doing it.

Also, we plan to get a forum reserved on the Den of Happiness BBS, get an official Internet address, and open up a WWIVnet POM subboard.

These three advances will help us automate our distribution, as well as spread out and reach more people.

I am also working with someone who will put POM in the Rush Limbaugh subs on CompuServe, as well as people to distribute POM on GEnie, Delphi, Prodigy, and the new e*World.

We plan on getting White House press releases delivered to our online address as they come out, so hopefully we can pick out interesting ones and put them in POM.

No other magazine (Printed or online) offers White House press releases for public consumption.

These and other changes will be attempted throughout 1995.

If, indeed, we can pull all of this off, we will rise to the forefront of online magazines.

We are determined to get better and better, until WE are the standard.

You can help us.

Send us feedback, continue to read us, and maybe even write an article for us.

POM plans to do '95, and do it good.

Hello, all! I am Kevin Salks, a relatively new writer to POM.

I plan on writing monthly.

If YOU can write at all, I encourage you to help out and do so as well.

Anyway, this column is about MY views, which are inherantly moderate.

Today I am tackling a topic that has come to the forefront of the media: Newt Gingrich, speaker of the House, and his book deal.

Recently, Gingrich announced he had made plans with a major printing company to write a book.

Now, obviously the question arises: Isn't this a conflict of interest? Writing a book while in a position of legislation is not exactly conducive to legislating.

However badly this move was thought out, the media has jumped at the chance to dent the new Republican Speaker's reputation.

With a new Republican majority in both the House and the Senate, Gingrich is a leader of the GOP.

The media, notoriously Democrat and biased to liberalism, has been searching for a scapegoat.

And they've found one.

Now, here is the ultimate question: Is this treatment justified? I must say no.

Why? A simple reason, of course.

Mr.

Gingrich's deals are his own business.

However if the public feels this is such a bad thing, they WILL speak up about it.

And then an inquiry may begin, thus resolving once and for all any problems or conflicts.

But I have another point of light to bring up.

Former-senator (now Vice President) Albert Gore wrote a book while serving as a senator.

Yet nothing was said about it.

Well, unless you count the reviews of the book and the promoters raving it.

What was this book? It was a slew of Mr.

Gore's personal feelings on such topics as animal rights and the environment.

Mr.

Gore, in case you didn't know, is a staunch liberal Democrat.

Perhaps this is why nothing was ever mentioned about his writing a book being a possible conflict of interest.

It all boils down to this: The media is biased, and they have let that show through way too much.

Whether writing a book while in office is indeed a conflict of interest remains to be resolved.

But the media certainly has it's motives for reporting this incident way off kilter.

If I remember correctly, they are supposed to be informing the public of happenings in an objective, unbiased method.

This has not happened.

To those responsible for this absurdity, I say "STOP IT!" And to Newt: You made a blunder.

At least this gives you a lesson in how the media eats Republicans alive.

Next time something like this happens, make sure you think the moral and civil implications through very carefully.

And to Mr.

Gore: Why aren't you commenting on this? Perhaps it's time to cross partisan boundaries and defend Mr.

Gingrich, or even better, denounce both of your actions.

People in the United States have been clinging to a myth for a very long time now - that the United States is a two party system.

Heck, they use the term "bipartisan" as if it means that all views are represented, when in fact it is only two opinions out of many.

We Libertarians know this is incorrect (and we have been using the term ourselves lately in Columbia, meaning Libertarians and Greens), but it's nice to have it verified by outside sources.

The source I used is my old college days history textbook: _Essentials_Of_American_History_.

It lists all of the Presidential elections from 1789 (I added 1988 and 1992): it lists most of the candidates who got anything near a significant vote total or an electoral vote.

See the chart below (Ed.

Note: At the end of the article)  As you can see, in fact a _three-way_ race is more common than any other.

Three-way races make up 44% of all of our Presidential elections, as a matter of fact (23 out of 52 total), and two- candidate races only make up 37% of all Presidential elections in history...

We have even had a few four and five-way races as well (19% of all elections).

And as an interesting note, look at how rare a two-way race is in the 20th Century as compared to the previous one.

Perhaps we could speculate WHY the cycle swings from multi-candidate elections to two- candidate elections.

It may have something to do with social upheaval -  you can point to many of the multi-party swings and they tend to correspond with social movements such as women's suffrage, the civil rights movement, etc.

They also somewhat correspond to economic stability as well, such as the current economic crisis (our national debt) corresponds with the current multi- candidate swing in the cycle.

I'm sure a more competent political scientist than I can figure out what happens and why:  the important thing is that, whatever the reasons, you can see that indeed multi-candidate and multi-partisan politics are no strangers to democracy in the United States.

Bill Clinton's Presidency is in a very troubled situation.

The crime bill which he loved so dearly suffered a major reduction last year in the House of Representatives.

It passed, but has had no effect on the old Gephardt health-care reform bill, which First Lady Hillary Clinton said was closer to the original Health Security Act of 1994, offered by the Clintons originally.

With health-care reform as one of the main, if not the main issue, the Clinton Administration is on the brink of a very dangerous political cliff.

But how has Clinton's administration proceded so far?  The oft-criticized administration has had various successes and failures, from everything from the economy to foreign policy.

The following is a look at some of the issues facing the President:  Clinton has so far stressed the economy more than any other problem facing the country, or seemingly so.

As of last year, the unemployment rate had fallen 1.5% since his inaguration, seeming to indicate success.

However, his economic plan far exceeded simply dealing with unemployment.

Budget Deficit: Clinton entered office with a $329.1 billion deficit, and 20% of the population angry as wet hens about the national debt.

Since then, the deficit has fallen to an estimated $167 billion for Fiscal Year 1995.

Clinton started with a deficit-reduction bill last summer, which would cut, over several years, $500 billion.

That figure is now estimated at $700 billion worth of cuts, due mostly to rising revenue, not falling spending.

The Clinton administration now repetitively boasts the first three years of deficit reduction since Harry Truman (despite the fact that the first year of deficit reduction -- fiscal year 1993 -- was initiated by George Bush.)  "Reforms": Bill Clinton and his administration may be known in history as the most sweeping social reformer since Lyndon B.

Johnson.

He once tried reforming both the health-insurance system, a feat on its own, and is now trying to reform the welfare system, a task which is none too easy.

To Clinton's credit is his very dilligent work on reforming the health-insurance system, perhaps one of the most earnest, massive efforts since Medicare and Medicaid.

As a result, the country could have seen one of two things: either a very massive change for the better in health insurance, or a very angry group of voters at the polls last November.

Guess which one happened.

The health-insurance reforms have faced numerous misinformation attacks, as well as informed attacks on the original Health Security Act, such as the large bureacracies which it would set up.

Also attacked, with good reason, were the methods of funding, primarily the employer mandate, which continues to face extinction in Congress.

Bill Clinton has worked remarkably hard for the health-care reforms he promised the country, and they have thus far been thoroughly defeated.

In the meanwhile, the President has also started working, much more quietly, on welfare reform.

His proposal, which attempts to put an end to subsidizing of teenage mothers, and to put people back on a payroll, were overshadowed heavily by the health-care reform efforts.

Now that Congress is controlled by welfare-hating Republicans, is reform imminent?  Free Trade: In 1993, President Clinton put forth a large lobbying effort as he attempted to pass the North America Free Trade Agreement, despite attacks by labor unions and Ross Perot.

Since that time, the economy seems stable, and exports to Mexico appear to be on the rise.

He worked on a much broader, though quieter, attempt at free trade.

Acceptance of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, has been a quiet goal of the Clinton administration.

This is one of the few goals they were able to attain.

The treaty will lower or freeze many international tariffs, and, among other things, establish a World Trade Organization to oversee the regulations of trade in participating countries.

Combining all these aspects of his economic plan, the President claims good economic stability.

It is true -- somewhat.

Although the economy has been growing steadily, the Federal Reserve Board, having raised interest rates, is now trying to slow down that growth to a slow but steady beat.

Some political speculators believe that this move is intended to prepare for stimulated growth in late 1995 or during 1996, the next presidential election year.

When he was selected as Vice Presidential running mate, Al Gore's history was as an environmentalist Senator from Tennessee.

However, the dminsitration has not conducted any broad efforts to favor the nvironment recently, except for a policy issued two years ago that the hite House would buy and use recycled paper, a light victory for ecyclers, whose overflowing stock of recycled paper was beginning to treaten the future of the recycling effort.

Clinton has been fairly quiet on human rights, with a few exceptions.

However, certain issues seem to stand out in the last two years.

Clinton started off his presidency with a review of the Army's policy towards homosexuals.

Although his public image was somewhat scarred by strong opposition from such military experts as Colin Powell and Sam Nunn, Clinton was able to better the military policy with a compromise "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, which has been criticized as a compromise of human rights.

The Clinton administration began with the army in Somalia, a move started in December of 1992.

The continuing effort there was labeled a humanitarian and democratic effort, and it was, until the death of 18 GIs forced Clinton to leave Somalia for safer ground.

Early last year, the administration, with strong efforts by former Majority Leader Gephardt, threatened to punish China's Most Favored Nation trade status as a result of continued, consistent, brutal human rights abuses.

Clinton, however, chose to renew the status, remarking on China's seat in the Security Council, and her fast growing economy, not to mention the reliance of over 100,000 jobs in the United States on Chinese importing and exporting.

His move quickly prompted criticism by human rights groups and many Congressmen, who blamed Clinton of sending a message to China: dictatorship and brutal human rights abuse would not only be tolerated, but also subsidized, by the United States.

On the home front, Clinton's stance on the death penalty has been brought into question.

The penalty, which was to be broadened in the crime bill, backfired on Clinton as some members of the House of Representatives found the death penalty too strong a barrier to them to allow it in the crime bill.

In the meanwhile, the debate has continued to spark controversy, although the Supreme Court has ruled it to be constitutional (in that it is not cruel and unusual).

Although usually a minor part of the administration, the Vice President has found a very active niche, relative to other Vice Presidents, in Clinton's administration.

Al Gore has established both the National Information Infrastructure and the National Performance Review (NPR).

The first was aimed at a federal role in the so-called Information Superhighway, and has prompted activation on the federal level to put the government on-line.

Many government agencies have found great success on the Internet, including the White House, and have been prompted by Gore's efforts to digitize the country.

Gore also worked on decreasing bureacracy in the NPR, and savings since then have been estimated in the billions.

Although the Vice President has not been palying a role in many controversial issues, he has played an important, unexpectedly active role in the administration.
