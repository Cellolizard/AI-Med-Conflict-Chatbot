While bryographic plants are typically encountered in

translatory and rotational motion.  One notices in such cases
an absence of the otherwise typical accretion of bryophyta.
We therefore conclude that a rolling stone gathers no moss.

efforts will make any difference in the result, but we must
never cease trying, for then the result is sure to be tyranny.

Since  the  first  cave  dweller ventured out to gaze up at the night
sky, people have sought to know more about the mysterious images  and
lights  seen  there.  Being  limited  by  what could be seen with the
unaided eye, that early stargazer relied on intellect and imagination
to depict the universe, etching images in stone  by  hand,  measuring
and  charting  the  paths  of the wanderers, and becoming as familiar
with the sky as the limited technology would allow.

Although stargazers frequently took the wrong paths in attempting  to
explain  what  they saw, many of them developed new tools to overcome
their limitations. Galileo crafted a fine telescope for observing the
heavens. His hand-drawn pictures of the satellites  of  Jupiter,  the
"cup  handles" of Saturn, and the phases of Venus, when combined with
the possible reasons for those facts, shook the very  foundations  of
the  European  society  in  the Middle Ages. Bigger and more powerful
telescopes, combined with even newer tools, such as spectroscopes and
cameras, have answered most of the the  questions  of  those  ancient
stargazers. But in doing so, they have unfolded even newer mysteries.

Beginning  in  the  1960s, our view of the heavens reached beyond the
obscuring atmosphere of Earth as unmanned spacecraft carried  cameras
and  other  data  sensors  to probe the satellites and planets of the
Solar System. Images those spacecraft sent back to the Earth provided
startling clarity to details that are  only  fuzzy  markings  on  the
planets'  surfaces when seen from Earth-based telescopes. Only two of
the presently known planets, Neptune and Pluto, remain unexplored  by
our  cameras.  In  August  1989, Voyager 2 will snap several thousand
closeup frames of the  planet  Neptune  and  its  largest  satellite,
Triton. By the end of the 20th century, only Pluto will not have been
visited by one of our spacecraft.

The knowledge humans have today of outer space would astound Galileo.
Spacecraft  have  sent  back  pictures  of  a  cratered and moon-like
surface of the planet Mercury and revealed  circulation  patterns  in
the  atmosphere  of  Venus.  From Mars, they have sent back images of
craters, giant  canyons,  and  volcanoes  on  the  planet's  surface.
Jupiter's   atmospheric   circulation   has   been  revealed,  active
volcanoes on the  Jovian  moon  Io  have  been  shown  erupting,  and
previously  unknown  moons and a ring circling the planet discovered.
New moons were found orbiting Saturn and  the  Saturnian  rings  were
resolved  in  such  detail  that  over 1,000 concentric ring features
became apparent. At Uranus, Voyager sent back  details  of  a  planet
that  is  covered  by  a featureless, bluish-green fog. The planet is
encircled by rings darker than charcoal  and  shaped  by  shepherding
satellites,  accompanied  by five large satellites, and immersed in a
magnetic field.

Those discoveries, and thousands  of  others  like  them,  were  made
possible  through  the  technology  of  telemetry,  the  technique of
transmitting data by means of radio  signals  to  distant  locations.
Thus,  the  spacecraft  not  only  carries data sensors but must also
carry a telemetry system to convert the data from the various sensors
into radio pulses. These pulses are received by a huge  dish  antenna
here  on  Earth.  The  signals  are  relayed  to  data  centers where
scientists and engineers can convert the radio pulses back  into  the
data the sensors originally measured.

A camera system on board the spacecraft measures reflected light from
a planet or satellite as it enters the spacecraft's optical system. A
computer  converts  the  measurements  into numerical data, which are
transmitted to  a  receiver  on  Earth  by  radio  waves.  On  Earth,
computers reassemble the numbers into a picture.

Because  the  measurements  are taken point by point, the images from
space are not considered "true" photographs,  or  what  photographers
call  a "continuous tone," but rather a facsimile image composed of a
pattern of dots assigned various shades  from  white  to  black.  The
facsimile image is much like the halftones newspapers use to recreate
photographs. ŽIf you examine a newspaper photograph with a magnifying
glass,  you  will  see  that  is is composed of many small, variously
shaded dots.

Even more closely related to the way images are received  from  space
is  the  way  a  television  set  works. For a picture to appear on a
television set, a modulated beam of light  rapidly  illuminates  long
rows  of tiny dots. filling in one line then the next until a picture
forms. These dots are called picture elements, or pixels  for  short,
and  the  screen  surface  where they are located is called a raster.
Raster scanning refers  to  the  way  the  beam  of  light  hits  the
individual  pixels  at  various  intensities to recreate the original
picture.  Of course, scanning happens very  fast,  so  it  is  hardly
perceptible to the human eye. Images from space are drawn in much the
same manner on a television-like screen (a cathode-ray tube).

Although  cameras  on a spacecraft probing the Solar System have much
in common with those in television  studios,  they  also  have  their
share  of  differences.  For  one,  the space-bound cameras take much
longer to form and transmit an image. While  this  may  seem  like  a
disadvantage,  it  is  not.  The images produced by the slow-scanning
cameras are of a much higher quality and contain more than twice  the
amount of information present in a television picture.

The  most  enduring  image  gatherer  in space has been the Voyager 2
spacecraft. Voyager carries a dual television  camera  system,  which
can  be  commanded  to  view  an  object  with either a wide-angle or
telephoto lens. The system is mounted on a science platform that  can
be  tilted  in any direction for precise aiming. Reflected light from
the  object  enters  the  lenses  and  falls  on  the  surface  of  a
selenium-sulfur  vidicon  television  tube,  11 millimeters square. A
shutter in the camera controls the amount of light reaching the  tube
and can vary exposure times from 0.005 second for very bright objects
to  15  seconds  or  longer  when searching for faint objects such as
unknown moons.

The vidicon tube temporarily holds the image on its surface until  it
can  be  scanned  for  brightness  levels. The surface of the tube is
divided into 800 parallel lines, each containing 800 pixels, giving a
total of 640,000. As each pixel is  scanned  for  brightness,  it  is
assigned a number from 0 to 255.

The  range  (0  to 255) was chosen because it coincides with the most
common counting unit in computer systems, a unit called  a  byte.  In
computers,  information  is  stored in bits and bytes. The bit is the
most fundamental counting or storage unit, while a byte is  the  most
useful  one.  A bit contains one of two possible values, and can best
be thought of as a tiny on-off switch on  an  electrical  circuit.  A
byte,  on  the  other hand, contains the total value represented by 8
bits. The value can be interpreted in many ways, such as a  numerical
value,  an  alphabet  character  or symbol, or a pixel shaded between
black and white. In a byte, the position of  each  bit  represents  a
counting power of 2. (By convention, bit patterns are read from right
to  left.)  Thus,  the  first bit (the righmost bit) of the eight bit
sequence represents 2 to the zero power, the second bit refers  to  2
to  the  1 power, and so on. For each bit in a byte that has a one in
it, you add the value of that power of two (the sequence value) until
all eight bits are counted.  For example, if the  byte  has  the  bit
value of 00101101, then it represents the number 45. The binary table
at  the  end of this document shows how translation of bits and bytes
to numbers is done.

If all the bits in an eight-bit  sequence  are  ones,  then  it  will
correspond  to  the  value 255. That is the maximum value that a byte
can count to. Thus, if a byte is used to represent shades of gray  in
an  image,  then by convention the lowest value, zero, corresponds to
pure black, while the highest value 255, corresponds to  pure  white.
All other values are intermediate shades of gray.

When  the  values  for  all  the  pixels have been assigned, they are
either sent directly to a receiver on Earth  or  stored  on  magnetic
tape to be sent later. Data are typically stored on tape on board the
spacecraft when the signals are going to be temporarily blocked, such
as  when  Voyager  passes  behind  a  planet or a satellite. For each
image, and its total of 640,000 pixels, 5,120,000 bits of  data  must
be  transmitted  (640,000  x  8). When Voyager flew close to Jupiter,
data were transmitted back to Earth at a rate of  more  than  100,000
bits  per  second.  This  meant  that  once  data  began reaching the
antennas on Earth's surface,  information  for  complete  images  was
received in about 1 minute for each transmission.

As  the  distance of the spacecraft from Earth increases, the quality
of the radioed data stream decreases and the rate of transmission  of
data  has  to  be  slowed  correspondingly.  Thus, at the distance of
Uranus, the data has to be transmitted some six to eight times slower
than could be done at Jupiter. That means that only one  picture  can
be  transmitted  in  the  time  six  pictures  were taken at Jupiter.
However, for the Uranus encounter, scientists and engineers devised a
scheme to get around that limitation.  The  scheme  was  called  data
compression.

To  do  that,  they  reprogrammed the spacecraft en route. Instead of
having Voyager transmit the full 8 bits for each pixel, its computers
were instructed to send back only the differences between  brightness
levels of successive pixels. That reduced the data bits needed for an
image  by  about 60 percent. Slowing the transmission rate meant that
noise did not interfere with the image reception, and by  compressing
the data, a full array of striking images was received. The computers
at  NASA's  Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory  (JPL)  restored  the correct
brightness  to  each  pixel,  producing  both   black-and-white   and
full-color images.

The  radio  signals  that a spacecraft such as Voyager sends to Earth
are received by a system of large dish antennas called the Deep Space
Network (DSN). The DSN  is  designed  to  provide  command,  control,
tracking  and  data  acquisition  for deep space missions. Configured
around the globe at locations approximately 120  degrees  apart,  DSN
provides 24-hour line-of-sight coverage.

Stations  are  located  at  Goldstone,  California,  and near Madrid,
Spain, and Canberra,  Australia.  The  DSN,  managed  by  NASA's  Jet
Propulsion  Laboratory  in  Pasadena,  California,  consists of three
64-meter  (210-ft)  diameter  dish-shaped  antennas,   six   34-meter
(111-ft)  diameter  antennas, and three 26-meter (85-ft) antennas. As
antennas at one  station  lose  contact,  due  to  Earth's  rotation,
antennas  at  the next station rotate into view and take over the job
of receiving spacecraft data. While one station is  tracking  a  deep
space  mission,  such  as  Voyager,  the  other two are busy tracking
spacecraft elsewhere in the sky.

During Voyager's contact with Saturn, the DSN recovered more than  99
percent of th 17,000 images transmitted. That accomplishment required
the  use of a technique known as "antenna arraying." Arraying for the
Saturn encounter was accomplished by  electronically  adding  signals
received  by two antennas at each site. Because of the great distance
Uranus is from the Earth, the signal received from Voyager 2 was only
one-fourth as strong as  the  signal  received  from  Saturn.  A  new
arraying  technique,  which  combined signals from four antennas, was
used during the Uranus encounter to allow up to 21,600 bits  of  data
to be received each second.

Arraying's   biggest  payoff  came  in  Australia,  whose  government
provided its Parkes Radio Astronomy Observatory 64-meter  antenna  to
be  linked  with  the  DSN's three-antenna complex near Canberra. The
most critical events of the  encounter,  including  Voyager's  closet
approaches  to Uranus and its satellites, were designed to occur when
the spacecraft would be transmitting to the complex in Australia. The
data were successfully relayed to JPL through that array.

The DSN was able to  track  Voyager's  position  at  Saturn  with  an
accuracy of nearly 150 kilometers (about 90 miles) during its closest
approach.   This   accuracy  was  achieved  by  using  the  network's
radiometric system, the spacecraft's cameras, and a technique  called
Very  Long  Baseline  Interferometry,  or  VLBI.  VLBI determines the
direction  of  the  spacecraft  by  precisely  measuring  the  slight
difference  between  the time of arrival of the signal at two or more
ground antennas. The same technique was used at  Uranus  to  aim  the
spacecraft so accurately that the deflection of its trajectory caused
by the planet's gravity would sent it on to Neptune.

When  the  DSN  antennas receive the information from the spacecraft,
computers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory store it  for  future  use
and  reassemble  it into images. To recreate a picture from data that
has been sent across the vacuum of space, computers read the data bit
by  bit,  calculating  the  values  for each pixel and converting the
value into a small square of light. The squares are  displayed  on  a
television  screen  on  the  spacecraft.   The  resulting  image is a
black-and-white facsimile of the object being measured.

Color images can be made by taking three  black-and-white  frames  in
succession  and  blending  ("registering") them on one another in the
three color-planes of a television screen. In order for that to work,
however, each of the three frames has to be taken by  the  camera  on
board the spacecraft through different filters. On Voyager, one frame
is  taken through a blue filter, one through a green, and one through
an orange.

Filters have varying effects on the amount of light  being  measured.
For  example,  light passes through a blue filter will favor the blue
values in the image  making  them  appear  brighter  or  transparent,
whereas  red or orange values will appear much darker than normal. On
Earth the three images  are  given  the  appropriate  colors  of  the
filters through which they were measured and then blended together to
give a color image.

An  important  feat  the interplanetary spacecraft must accomplish is
focusing on its target while  traveling  at  extremely  high  speeds.
Voyager sped past Uranus at more then 40,000 miles an hour. To get an
unblurred  image,  the  cameras  on board had to steadily track their
target while the camera shutters were open. The technique to do this,
called  image-motion  compensation,  involves  rotating  the   entire
spacecraft  under  the  control  of  the  stabilizing gyroscopes. The
strategy was used successfully both at Saturn's satellite Rhea and at
Uranus.  Both  times,   cameras   tracked   their   targets   without
interruption.

Once  the  image is reconstructed by computers on Earth, it sometimes
happens that objects appear nondescript  or  that  subtle  shades  in
planetary  details  such  as  cloudtops cannot be discerned by visual
examination alone. This can be overcome, however, by adding  a  final
"contrast  enhancement"  to  the  production. The process of contrast
enhancement is like adjusting the contrast and brightness controls on
a television set. Because the shades of the  image  are  broken  down
into   picture  elements,  the  computer  can  increase  of  decrease
brightness values of individual pixels,  thereby  exaggerating  their
difference and sharpening even the tiniest details.

For  example,  suppose  a  portion  of  an  image returned from space
reveals an  area  of  subtle  gray  tones.  Data  from  the  computer
indicates  the  range in brightness values is between 98 and 120, and
all are fairly evenly distributed. To the unaided  eye,  the  portion
appears  as  a  blurred  gray patch because the shades are too nearly
similar to be discerned.  To  eliminate  this  visual  handicap,  the
brightness  values  can  be  assigned  new numbers. The shades can be
spread farther apart, say five  shades  apart  rather  than  the  one
currently  being  looked  at.  Because the data are already stored on
computers, it is a fairly  easy  task  to  isolate  the  twenty-three
values and assign them new ones: 98 could be assigned 20, 99 assigned
25,  and so on. The resulting image is "enhanced" to the unaided eye,
while the information is the same accurate data transmitted from  the
vicinity of the object in space.

The  past  25 years of space travel and exploration have generated an
unprecedented quantity of data from planetary systems.  Images  taken
in  space and telemetered back to Earth have greatly aided scientists
in formulating better and more accurate theories about the nature and
origin of our Solar System. Data gathered at close  range,  and  from
above  the  distorting  effects of Earth's atmosphere, produce images
far more detailed than pictures taken by even the largest Earth-bound
telescopes.

In our search to understand the world as  well  as  the  universe  in
which  we live, we have in one generation reached farther than in any
other generation before us.  We  have  overcome  the  limitations  of
looking  from  the surface of our planet and have traveled to others.
Whatever yearning drew those first stargazers from  the  security  of
their  caves  to  look up at the night sky and wonder still draws men
and women to the stars.

"War is a profanity because, let's face it, you've got two opposing sides
trying to settle their differences by killing as many of each other as
they can."

Which brings us to nuclear weapons...

Since the first test at Alamogordo, our world governments have exploded
in total over 2000 of these devices at their bombing ranges (Lop Nor,
Kazhakstan, Nevada, Micronesia). They've done it in the air, on the ground,
below the ground, and in the water. The tests still go on today.

The purpose of this archive is to illuminate to the reader the effects
of these nasty devices, and to warn against their use.

At this time, although the threat of a nuclear world war has reduced,
there are other threats to our tentative peace which have emerged.
These involve regional conflicts, and the activities of terrorist parties
or nations. They involve issues such as plutonium smuggling, and the sale
of weapons technology (possibly clandestine) to militaristic nations.

Continued nuclear testing is also another problem. It reinforces the
position of the London Club nations, and gives incentive to the rest of
the world for removing their monopoly. In fact, this was China's
justification for joining the Club. With Pakistan and North Korea's incipient
entry, horizontal proliferation is a tangible threat. You can expect nations
involved in regional conflicts to back their threats up with a nuclear fist if
they have one. If you have a weapon and your survival is threatened, there is a
strong chance you will use it in defense, no matter the consequences. This was
the U.S. Government's justification for the A-bombing of Japan. It saved the
lives of their soldiers. Little mention was made of Japanese
civilians (collateral damage).

The decision to bomb Japan was made in secret. This led directly to the arms
race we are currently involved in. Russia felt threatened, and embarked on
its own bomb program, eventually producing one in 1949. In turn, the Americans
felt threatened, and embarked on the thermonuclear program. This culminated in
the pivotal Mike test of 1952. Nuclear blackmail during the Korean War led
China to make a bomb. Public disclosure and discussion before Hiroshima would
have helped avoid the situation we are in today. Hence the need for an informed
and vigilant worldwide public.

Within the nucleus of a cell are found the chromosomes, long irregular
threads of genetic material.  These chromosomes are arranged in pairs:
19 pairs in a cat, 23 pairs in a human.  It is these 38 chromosomes
that contain the "blueprint" for the individual cat.

When inspected under a microscope, the chromosomes reveal irregular
light and dark bands:  hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions per
chromosome.  These light and dark bands are the genes, the actual
genetic codes.  Each gene controls a single feature or group of fea-
tures in the makeup of the individual.  Many genes interact:  a single
feature may be controlled by one, two, or a dozen genes.  This makes
the mapping of the genes difficult, and only a few major genes have
been mapped out for the cat.

The chromosome is itself composed primarily of the macromolecule DNA,
(deoxyribonucleic acid):  one single molecule running the entire
length of the chromosome.  DNA is a double helix, like two springs
wound within each other.  Each helix is composed of a long chain of
alternating phosphate and deoxyribose units, connected helix to helix
by ladder-like rungs of four differing purine and pyridamine com-
pounds.

It is not the number of differing compounds that provide the secret of
DNA's success, but rather the number of rungs in the ladder (uncounted
millions) and the order of the amino acids that make up the rungs.
The four different amino acids are arranged in groups of three, form-
ing a 64-letter alphabet.  This alphabet is used to compose words of
varying length, each of which is a gene (one particular letter is
always used to indicate the start of a gene).  Each gene controls the
development of a specific characteristic of the lifeform.  There is an
all-but-infinite number of possible genes.  As a result, the DNA of a
lifeform contains its blueprint, no two alike, and the variety and
numbers of possible lifeforms has even today barely begun.

                     Mitosis and Mendel

When a cell has absorbed enough of the various amino acids and other
compounds necessary, it makes another cell by dividing.  This process
is called mitosis, and is fundamental to life.

Not too long ago, it was thought that the chromosomes were generated
immediately prior to mitosis, and dissolved away afterwards.  This
turned out not to be true.  The extremely tiny chromosomes, normally
invisible in an optical microscope, shorten and thicken during mito-
sis, becoming visible temporarily.

The rather complex process of mitosis can perhaps be explained simply
as a step-by-step process:

Mitosis begins when the cell senses sufficient growth and nutrients to

support two cells.

The invisible chromosomes duplicate themselves through the wonder of
DNA replication.  Various enzymes are used as keys to unlock and
unwind the double helix into two single helices.  Each of these he-
lices then uses other enzymes to lock the proper parts (the amino
acids and other stuff) together to build a new second helix, complete
with all transverse rungs, so that the results will be exact replicas
of the original double helix.  This winding and unwinding of the DNA
can take place at speeds up to 1800 rpm!  The two daughter chromosomes
remain joined at a single point, called the centromere.

The cromosomes then wind themselves up, shortening and thickening,
making them visible under the microscope, and attach themselves to the
nuclear membrane.

The nuclear membrane then dissolves into a fibrous spindle, with at
least one fiber passing through each centromere (there are many more
fibers than centromeres).

The fibers then stretch and pull the centromeres apart, pulling the
chromosomes to opposite sides of the cell.

The spindles dissolve into two new nuclear membranes, one around each
group of chromosomes.

The chromosomes unwind back into invisibility, the cell divides, and
mitosis is complete.  Genetically, each daughter cell is an exact
duplicate of the parent cell.

Since the genetic coding is carried in the rungs of the DNA and only
consists of four different materials arranged in groups of three to
form words of varying length written with a 64-letter alphabet, the
instructions for a "cat" may be considered to consist of two sets of
19 "books," each millions of words long, one set from each of the
cat's parents.  The numbers of possible instructions are more than
astronomical:  there are far more possible instructions in one single
chromosome than there are atoms in the known universe!

A single gene is a group of instructions of some indeterminate length.
Somewhere among all the other codes is a set of instructions composing
the "white" gene, and what that set says will determine if the cat is
white or non-white.

Since a cat receives two sets of instructions, one from each parent,
what happens when one parent says "make the fur white" and the other
says "make the fur non-white"?  Will they effect a compromise and make
the fur pastel?  No, they will not.  Each and every single gene has at
least two levels of expression (many have more), called alleles, which
will determine the overall effect.  In the case given, the "make the
fur white" allele, "W", is dominant, while the "make the fur non-
white" allele, "w", is recessive.  As a result, the fur may be white
or non-white, not pastel (we're only speaking of the "white" gene
here, a gray cat is caused by an entirely different gene).

The double-dominant "WW" white cat has only white alleles in its white
genes.  It is classed as homozygous (same-celled) for white, and will
produce only white offspring, regardless of the karyotype of its mate.

The single-dominant "Ww" or "wW" white cat has one of each allele in
its white genes.  It is classed as heterozygous (different-celled) for
white, and may or may not produce white offspring, depending upon the
karyotype of its mate.

The recessive "ww" non-white cat has only non-white alleles in its
white genes.  It is classed as homozygous for non-white, and may or
may not produce white offspring, depending upon the karyotype of its
mate.

Assuming these cats mate, there are sixteen different possible karyo-
type combinations.  Since each cat in these sixteen combinations will
pass on to their offspring one and only one allele, there are four
possible genetic combinations from each mating.  There are sixty-four
possible combinations of offspring.

Palpation is a physical exam of the breast. The doctor
examines each breast and underarm by feeling the tissue. Although
a doctor can tell a lot by the way the lump feels, no one can be
certain what a lump is just by palpation.

Aspiration, also called fine needle aspiration can help the
doctor discover whether the lump is a cyst (fluid-filled) or a
solid mass of tissue. Aspiration is usually done in the doctor's
office. First, the doctor uses a local anesthetic to numb the
area. Then, the doctor inserts a needle into the lump and tries
to withdraw fluid. If it is a cyst, removing the fluid will
collapse it. The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing to
be sure no cancer cells are present. When the lump is solid, the
doctor sometimes removes a sample of cells with the needle. These
cells are then sent to a laboratory for analysis.

A mammogram is a type of x-ray that creates an image of the
breast on film or paper. It can help determine whether a lump is
benign or cancerous. In fact, it often can detect cancer in the
breast before a lump can be felt. The National Cancer Institute
(NCI) suggests that beginning at age 40, all women should have a
mammogram every 1 to 2 years. When a woman reaches 50, she should
have a mammogram each year. A doctor may also recommend a
mammogram if any sign or symptom of breast cancer is found,
regardless of age.
Several other methods also are being studied. None is now
reliable enough to be used alone, but they may be helpful when
combined with other methods.

Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to get an image of the breast and can help determine
if a lump is a cyst or a solid mass. It is usually used along
with palpation and mammography.

Diaphanography, or transillumination, shines a light through
the breast to show its inner features.

Thermography measures the heat patterns in the breast to
produce an image.

A biopsy is the only certain way to learn whether a breast
lump or suspicious area seen on a mammogram is cancer. In a
biopsy, the doctor surgically removes all or part of the lump and
sends it to the laboratory for analysis. There are several biopsy
methods that a doctor may use: needle biopsy, incisional biopsy,
excisional biopsy, and mammographic localization with biopsy.
Occasionally the doctor will do a needle biopsy to remove a
small amount of tissue from the lump. A needle biopsy can be
performed in the doctor's office. This is most often done when
cancer is suspected and the doctor hopes to confirm the diagnosis
immediately. If cancer is not found, a more thorough biopsy will
follow.
Once, it was thought that inserting a needle or cutting into
a breast lump might cause cancer to spread. This is not true.
An incisional biopsy is the surgical removal of a portion of
a lump. This procedure is often used when the growth is very
large. Again, if no cancer is found, a more thorough biopsy may
follow to make sure the entire lump is free of cancer.
In an excisional biopsy the doctor removes the entire lump.
This is currently the "standard" biopsy procedure and the most
thorough method of diagnosis. Incisional and excisional biopsies
are usually done in the outpatient department of a hospital.
Either a local or general anesthetic may be used.
Mammographic localization with biopsy (also known as needle
localization) is used for suspicious areas such as
microcalcifications (tiny specks of calcium) that cannot be felt
but can be seen on a mammogram. During this procedure the breast
is x-rayed and small needles are placed to outline the suspicious
area for the surgeon who then removes the tissue for biopsy.
This can be done using a local anesthetic in the outpatient
department of a hospital.
Your doctor may suggest one or more of these procedures to
evaluate a lump or other change in your breast. The doctor may
also suggest watching the suspicious area for a month or two.
Because many lumps are caused by normal hormonal changes, this
waiting period may provide additional information.
However, if you feel uncomfortable about waiting, speak with
your doctor about your concerns. You also may want to get a
second opinion, perhaps from a breast specialist or surgeon. Many
cities have breast clinics where you can get a second opinion.
The Cancer Information Service also may be able to help you
locate doctors to consult.

What will the doctor be able to learn from a biopsy?

The biopsy can tell the doctor whether your lump is benign
or malignant. If it is cancer, your doctor will talk with you
about choices of treatments, and you may be advised to get a
second opinion. (You can call the Cancer Information Service for
other NCI publications that deal with breast cancer treatment.)
If no cancer is found, you may be told that the lump or
suspicious area is the result of a fibrocystic condition,
fibrocystic disease, benign breast disease, or one of many other
conditions. Remember, 80 percent of all breast lumps are not
cancer.

What is a fibrocystic condition, fibrocystic disease, or
benign breast disease?

Unfortunately, doctors do not agree on standard terms for
benign breast changes. We prefer to use the term benign breast
condition for those changes in a woman's breasts that are not
cancerous. These include normal changes that occur during the
menstrual cycle as well as benign lumps that can appear in the
breast. If your doctor uses a different term, or one you do not
understand, ask for an explanation.

How many women have a benign breast condition?

It is estimated that at least 50 percent of all women have
irregular or "lumpy" breasts. In addition, many doctors believe
that nearly all women have some benign breast changes beginning
at age 30. A woman is more likely to have these breast changes if
she has never had children, has had irregular menstrual cycles,
has a family history of breast cancer, or is thin. Women who have
had more than one child and women who are taking birth control
pills have a reduced risk.

What are the symptoms of a benign breast condition?

Women may have increased "lumpiness" with tenderness, pain,
and swelling just before their period begins. These symptoms
lessen after the menstrual period, only to reappear the next
month. Many women find that these symptoms disappear after
menopause.
Benign breast lumps may appear at any time. Some cause pain,
others don't. They may be large or small, soft or rubbery, fluid-
filled or solid, and movable. In addition, some benign breast
conditions may produce a discharge from the nipple.

JUST TWO DECADES ago, black holes were an interesting footnote to our
astronomical theories that few non-specialists had heard about.  Today, black
holes have "arrived" - one hears about them in Hollywood thrillers, in cartoon
strips, and more and more on the science pages of your local newspaper.

What exactly are these intriguing cosmic objects and why have they so
captured the imagination of astronomers and the public?

A black hole is what remains after the death of a very massive star.
Although stars seem reasonably permanent on human time scales, we know that
over the eons all stars will run out of fuel and eventually die.  When smaller
stars like our own Sun burn out, they simply shrink under there own weight
until they become so compact they cannot be compressed any further.  (This will
not happen to the Sun for billions of years, so there is no reason to add a
rider to your home owners policy at this time!)

When the largest (most massive) stars have no more fuel left, they have a
much more dramatic demise in store for them.  These stars have so much material
that they just cannot support themselves once their nuclear fires go out.
Current theories predict that nothing can stop the collapse of these huge
stars.	Once they begin to die, whatever remains of them will collapse FOREVER.

As the collapsing star falls in on itself, pull of gravity near its surface
will increase.	Eventually its pull will become so great that nothing - not
even light - can escape, the star will look BLACK to an outside observer.  And
anything you throw into it will never return.  Hence astronomers have dubbed
these collapsed stellar corpses "black holes."

Alert readers will quickly note that this expanation of black holes does not
bode well for finding one.  How do we detect something that cannot give off any
light (or other form of radiation)?  You might suggest that we can spot a black
hole as it blocks the light of stars that happens to lie behind it.  That might
work if the black hole hovered near the Earth, but for any black holes that are
a respectful distance away in space, the part of the sky it would cover would
be so small as to be invisible.

To make matters worse, the sort of black hole that forms from a single
collapsing star would be only 10 or 20 miles across - totally insignificant in
size compared to most objects astronomers study and much too small to help a
distant black hole hunter on Earth.

The size of a black hole, by the way, is not the size of the collapsing star
remnant.  The stuff of the former star does continue to collapse forever inside
the black hole.  What gives the hole its "size" is a special zone around the
star's collapsing core, called the "event horizon." If you are outside this
zone, and you have a powerfull rocket, you still have a chance to get away.
Once you passed inside this zone, the gravitational pull of the collapsing
stuff is so great, nothing you can do can help you from being pulled inexorably
to your doom.  The name "event horizon" comes from the fact that once objects
are inside the zone, events that happen to them can no longer be communicated
to the outside world.  It is as if a tight "horizon" has been wrapped around
the star.

How then could we detect these bizzare objects and verify the strange things
predicted about them?  It turns out that far away from a black hole the only
way to detect it is to "watch it eating."

If a black hole forms in a single star system, there is very little material
close to the collapsed remnant for its enormous gravity to pull in.  But we
believe that more than half of the stars form in double, triple or multiple
systems.  When two stars orbit each other in proximity, and one becomes a black
hole, the other one may have some difficult times ahead.

Under the right circumstances, material from the outer regions of the normal
star will begin to flow toward its black hole companion.  As particles of this
stolen material are pulled into a twisting, whirling stream around the black
hole's event horizon, they are heated to enormous temperatures.  They quickly
become so hot that they glow - not just with visable light, but with far more
energetic X-rays.  (Of course, all this can be seen only above the event
horizon; once the material falls into the horizon, we have no way of ever
seeing it again.)

Astronomers began searching in the 1970s for the tell-tale X-rays that
indicate that a black hole is consuming a part of its neighbor star.  Since
cosmic X-rays are blocked by the Earth's atmosphere, these observations became
possible only when we could launch sensitive X-ray telescopes into space.  But
in the last decade and a half, at least three excellent candidates for a
"feeding" black hole have been identified.

Probably the best-known case is called Cygnus X-1, a system in the
constellation of Cygnus the swan, in which we see a normal star that appears to
be going around a region of space with nothing visable in it.  Smack dab from
the middle of that region, we see just the sort of X-rays that reveal the
stream of material being sucked into the hole.

While this sort of indirect evidence is not quite as satisfying as seeing a
black hole "up close," for now (and perhaps fortunately) it will have to do.
What is intriguing astronomers these days is the posibility that enormous black
holes may have formed in crowded regions of space.  These may not just eat part
of a companion star, but may actually consume many of their neighbor stars
eventually.  What we would then have is an even larger black hole, able to eat
even more of the material in its immediate neighborhood.

In the most populated areas of a galaxy - for example, its center - black
holes may ultimately form that contain the material of a million or billion
stars.	In recent years, astronomers have begun to see tantalizing evidence
from the center of our own galaxy and from violent galaxies in the distant
reaches of space indicating that such supermassive black holes may be more
common than we ever imagined.  If this evidence is further confirmed, we may
find that the strange black hole plays an important role not only in the death
of a few stars but even in the way entire galaxies of stars evolve.


Prologue:  Before launching into the body of this article, there are a few
things that I want to set straight.  First, those who dislike films are advised
to re-read the title.  To the best of my knowledge, a good number of science
fiction buffs, myself included, moonlight as film fans.  I've had enough
experience though with all of the various subgenres within the sf/horror field
to know that there may be many polar opposites, and I don't expect everyone to
be into films.	It is to those readers who find cinema more bearable than
fingernails on a blackboard, and most of all for my own pleasure, that this
article is written.  As a footnote, those who dislike film "fans" and look down
at buffs of that or any other entertainment medium, earn somewhat less respect
from yours truly.  (The same principle applies to film buffs with a similar
snobbish attitude toward nonfilm buffs.) I can better understand opposition to
all vicarious imitations of life than I can to one specific type.  In my
opinion, matters of private taste cannot legitimately be represented as dogma
without exposing the proponent as a pompous fool.  Any door that fails to swing
both ways is nothing more than a sham.

 Second, while all of the films reviewed here in capsule form are available to
television there isn't a "made-for-TV" picture in the lot.  Everything here
received some, if in many cases very limited, theatrical distribution.	The
thoughts expressed reflect nothing more concrete than my own subjective
impressions.  I also want to stress that the "standards" employed are those
observed during more casual viewings such as on television.  Entertainment
value, except that provided by unintentional camp, has most definitely been
taken into consideration.  This may appear self-evident, but a handful of
self-styled "Film Scholars" look down on this approach.  In one sense, the
following collection was compiled at random, but in another, the structure is
deceptively formal.  My avoidance of over-publicized titles is deliberate.
Many of the best---and many of the worst---films in the genre have been exposed
to the point of absolutely indelible deja-vu.  You will find no signs of Bride
of Frankenstein, Night of the Living Dead, Alien or King Kong (the first
version) here.	Neither, granting equal time for the same reason, will you be
forced to encounter the movies over-exposed due to their "lack" of quality such
as Plan Nine From Outer Space, Robot Monster, Bride of the Monster, and Cat
Women of the Moon.) Sitting through films of this prestigious nature may offer
greater promise of satisfaction, but if I read one more word about them, I'll
scream!

 As a result of my efforts to bypass monotony, the majority of those films
I've chosen to cover are relatively obscure, even among circles of
horror/sf/fantasy film fans.  As a further result, most are ultra-low budget
(not necessarily a pejorative), shoe-string and independent productions that
ended up being distributed to quickie first-run openings, the drive-in circuit,
kiddies' matinees and all-night flophouses, if at all.  Even on the tube,
treatment is shabby; these are more likely run as late night second features
and specialty shows than on the networks (although, ironically, that's where
two on this list debute TV-wise).  The names at the end of each capsule review
are those of the lead players; the country at the opening denotes the origin.

      +  +  +

 The Astro-Zombies (USA, 1971).  The title gives us an accurate picture.
Mindless, amateurish mishmash of pseudo-horror and espionage as operatives of
"both" sides compete for a mad doctor's reanimation device.  Neither seems
particularly concerned that the "zombies" automatically engage in murderous
rampages, and we, the audience, aren't given any clear indication of the
motives behind such anti-social behaviour other than that the reanimated
corpses are instantly struck with a compulsion to kill females.  (The "mad
scientist," incidentally, is aided by a traditionally hunchbacked lab
assistant, while an ever present and unidentified woman spends the entire
picture strapped to a table, periodically screaming and fainting, but serving
no apparent purpose other than the titillation of kinkier viewers.) Absurdist
trash might be tolerated by the kiddies, but it's doubtful that anyone else
will go for it.  Even the laughs, and they do exist to a limited extent, aren't
enough to prevent the itches from attacking.  Tom Pace, Joan Patrick, John
Carradine, Wendall Corey, Rafael Campes, Victor Izay.

 Boy Who Cried Werewolf (USA, 1973) This lightweight mediocrity reminiscent of
the slightly more palatable 50's quickies is no great shakes, but does
relatively well considering the extent of potentially lethal drawbacks facing
it.  (For example, the incredibly unconvincing "make-up" closely resembling a
second-rate Halloween costume, laughably hammy acting by the person behind the
obvious mask, the cornball equation of "hippy" and "Jesus" movements, the
intrusion of exceptionally bad comedy relief and some stereotypic soap opera
exchanged between the film's love interests.) A man is turned into Werewolf by
a lycanthropy bite received during a wilderness trip and is discovered by his
prepubescent son whose vain attempts to convince others that his findings are
more than flights of fancy justify the title.  Merely fair (and then only by
grade "B" standards), yet still a miniature cut above its economic
counterparts, but leaves little, if any after taste.  Not worth going out of
one's way to see, and probably won't make a powerful enough impression to be
remembered on anyone's "ten worst" list, but at least it shouldn't agonize
shut-ins.  Scott Sealey, Kerwin Matthews, Elaine Devry, Bob Hommel, Robert J
Wilke, Susan Foster.

 Cave of the Living Dead (Germany, 1962) Atrociously dubbed and talky,
plodding and chiefly uneventful crud effort at combining espionage and horror.
The secret agent investigating mass murders suspected to be of a cloak and
dagger nature learns that they were actually committed by a colony of modern
day vampires.  Dullsville incarnate.  Health and Welfare should attach a
warning to this one.  Carl Mohner, Adrian Hoven, John Kitzmiller, Wolfgang
Priess.

 Creature With the Blue Hand (Germany, 1969) Another in the string of oddball
crime films Germans are so fond of labelling "horror." Most are released
directly to TV in this country, although this one was an exception, having been
distributed with the Phillipines-shot Beast of the Yellow Night.  This badly
dubbed murder mystery with horror overtones tells of an innocent man wrongly
convicted of being a costumed mass murderer (the uniform's glove is blue; hence
the title, which is an example of limb climbing if I've ever seen it) who
escapes prison intent on establishing innocence by (literally) unmasking the
true culprit.  No better and no worse than others of its ilk; about average, in
fact, but in light of the field's general condition, I see no reason to torture
oneself.  Harold Leipnitz, Klaus Kinski, Diana Koerning, Carl Lange.

 Equinox (USA, 1968) An amateur film, which was rewarded with (limited)
commercial release after being screened by poverty-row distributors, shows it's
home movie origins (except in the surprisingly good special effects and the
talented script) and for that reason alone may be unfairly condemned without a
trial by purists and pseudo-intellectuals, but if so, it's their loss.
Redeemed by a consistently bizarre atmosphere, this is no unforgettable
classic, but it is several cuts above the average "cheapie." College students
come up against satanic forces while searching for a professor (Fritz Leiber in
a brief but pivotal role) who disappeared while investigating the occult in a
rural site.  The script consistently alternates the refreshingly plausible (as
grade B horror films go) and the outrageous.  This film was more impressive at
the release date, before screen depictions of Satan and his minions had grown
commonplace.  Edward Connel, Barbara Hewitt.

 Frankenstein's Bloody Terror (Spain, 1968) Ohmigod!  Most foreign cheapies
are pretty bad, yes, but this utterly brainless garbage, apparently designed
with grade-schoolers intentionally in mind, makes the others look good.  Most
imports suffer from tawdry American treatment (bad dubbing, editing, etc.) and
while this is no exception, it looks as if it were miserable to begin with.
Unfortunate viewers will wonder what the title has to do with the content if
they miss the brief (and probably tacked on by US distributors) explanation
that the Frankenstein clan changed it's name somewhere along the line to
"Wolfstein" and were cursed with lycanthropy as punishment for the Baron's
crimes.  Yeah, sure.  Worse yet, the miasmic plot concentrates on an unrelated
man turned into a werewolf by a bite from (you guessed) it) Wolfstein.	Further
complicating this topsy-turvy mess, his efforts to find a cure lead to his
unwitting involvement with a vampire pair posing as professional exorcists to
secure a steady stream of victims.  Unsurpassed idiocy.  Among the screen's
darkest moments.  The extremely tacky look that leaves no question about the
picture's financial status compounds my amazement that this one ever made it to
other shores.  Paul Naschy (the Spanish John Belushi), Diana Zura, Mike Manza,
Gilbert Granger, Anita Avery.

 The Fury (Usa, 1978) Poor old Brian DePalma temporarily lived down his
positive reputation with this tedious hokum, as bad as most of the worst "C"
cheapies, but without the excuse of a shoestring budget to make it more
tolerable.  A muddled fantasy-horror-espionage combination where, following the
abduction of his telekinetic son, a former spy sets out to crush an
unscrupulous cloak and dagger outfit utilizing paranormal secret weapons.  No
sense of enthusiasm is radiated, although it is to be assumed that at least a
smidgen was involved.  This vapid absurdity is dull enough that the potential
for camp is rarely realized.  Kirk Douglas, Amy Irving, Carrie Snodgrass, John
Casavettes, Charles During, Carol Rossen, Andrew Stevens.

 Invasion From Inner Earth (Canada, 1974) Markedly shoddy physical appearance,
an indicator of the virtually nonexistent budget is transcended by
stress-building tension and a weird atmosphere in an eerie Night of the Living
Dead imitation.  Travelers stranded in a strangely deserted rural Manitoba
encounter aggressive emissaries of a subterranean race.  Attention to a "hollow
Earth" theory and a brooding sense of doom dominates this cheap but creepy
little yarn.  Certain elements, like the theft of The Good, the Bad, and the
Ugly theme song are better left ignored.  This film is no classic, but has more
to offer than it initially leads us to believe.  Slightly more competent acting
than traditionally associated with these ultra-cheapies comes in handy.  Paul
Bentzen, Debbie Pick, Nick Holt, Karl Wallace.

 Let's Scare Jessica to Death (USA, 1971) Regarded as a "mini-sleeper" by
some, this uneven shocker does indeed posses isolated moments, but they are too
far between to sustain closer examination.  A string of film clips might have
been more effective...	A former mental patient and her husband move to a small
town inhabited by vampires.  Her observations are, of course, taken as
symptomatic of mental illness.	The moderately unexciting script could benefit
from a more stable flow of events.  This one has potential, but is skittish.
Zhora Lampert, Kevin O'Conner, Barton Heyward, Gretchen Corbett, Mark
Claire-Costello.

 Lost Continent (UK, 1969) (This is not to be confused with the earlier
"dinosaur" film of the same name.) This painfully juvenile film adaptation of
Denis Wheatley's Uncharted Island might satisfy the youngsters, but it is
unsuitable fare for anyone else.  In a Victorian setting, sea-going smugglers
and their unwary passengers are stranded in unfamiliar territory where they run
into monsters and a hostile civilization.  Nothing much happens, which means
that Wheatley's novel must not have been followed very closely.  This is not
just a bad Hammer film, but a bad film period, and not at all what we've come
to expect from the England.  Eric Porter, Hildegare Neff, Tony Beckley, Nigel
Stock, Suzannah Leigh.

 Man Who Haunted Himself (UK, 1970) Imaginative, and stylish, if somewhat
prolix, novelty.  As the title implies, an executive recently discharged from
the hospital is jeopardized by his unscrupulous double.  No Citizen Kane, but
this obscure, almost unknown sf movie should be seen by those who insist that
the field has never produced anything of worth.  The "surprise" ending,
previously used in another picture is predictable, but what the heck.  Viewers
who didn't see the antecedent might be impressed.  Roger Moore, Hildegarde Neil
(not Neff), Anton Rogers, Olga Georges-Picon, Thorley Waters, Alastair
MacKenzie.

 Man With the Icy Eyes (Italy/USA, 1971) This inept crime/melodrama/mystery
with almost incidental supernatural overtones isn't as inspired as some in the
foreign-cheapie category, and never attains more than run-of-the-mill stature.
Likewise, the uneven dubbing isn't uniformly bad, but just obvious enough to
let us know that it wasn't shot in Hollywood.  A newspaper is menaced by
elements of both mortal and occult origin while trying to vindicate an
erroneously convicted assassin.  The obvious efforts at trying to generate
suspense fail.	Fair as late night TV features go, an evaluation which you may
interpret as you like.	Antonio Sabato, Barbara Bouchet, Victor Buono, Keenan
Wynn.

 People That Time Forgot (UK - USA, 1977) The dinosaurs are more convincing
than the virtually catatonic lead player, although the supporting cast is
adequate at light work.  If one is able to ignore Patrick Wayne's wooden
performance and some of the uproariously sexist dialogue (causing one to wonder
if this is what the title refers to), this so-so film version of E R B's novel
is one of the more palatable of the special kiddie matinee-oriented fantasy
adventures.  A search party hunting a missing war hero in the Antarctic
discover a "lost" tropical area populated by prehistoric beasts, warring
tribesmen, and the obligatory volcano.	No new ground is broken, but the
execution is somewhat above the average lost world opus.  The inconsistent
special effects alternate between the exemplary and the poor.  This innocuous
froth holds little for anyone past puberty, but if you can recall your younger
days, it's not too bad.  Beside Wayne, principals include Sarah Douglas,
Thorley Waters, Dana Gillespie, Doug McClure.

 S-S-S-S (USA, 1973) Almost no atmosphere or suspense, but a mildly diverting
script and a lack of pretension make up for it.  An unwitting college student
is subjected to experiments by a typically deranged serum researcher intent on
solving our problems by creating a snake-Homo Sapiens hybrid.  A fun film, with
a healthy sense of vitality, this one is raised from being another juvenile
"monster-on- the-loose" picture by not taking itself too seriously.  The
tounge-in-cheek approach plays it straight for the kiddies, and as near-satire
for adults.  Strother Martin, Dirk Benedict, Heather Menzies, Jack Gina,
Richard B Shull.

 Stanley (USA, 1970) This one seems indecisive about whether it wants to be
psychological horror, action-adventure, mild crime, or an "anti- establishment
youth cult" film.  It compromises in nearly episodic fashion, and as a result,
fails miserably in each department.  The first half, straight adventure,
focusing on a defender-of- wildlife Vietnam veteran (who happens to be a native
American) who skirmishes with a band of villainous hunters is just typical
haphazard cheap film fare.  It goes progressively downhill in the second half
where he abruptly transforms into a homicidal maniac using snakes as a murder
weapons.  The one- dimensional nature is emphasized by the film's pretension of
"making a statement".  Unbelievable finale.  Chris Robinson, Susan Carole, Alex
Rocco, Steve Alaimo.

 Teenage Zombies (USA, 1960) When players actually speak lines like "eck" and
"ugh", you know what to expect.  Incredibly bad, outrageously amateurish,
substandard by even home movie standards, this is representative of the era
ostentatiously oriented toward adolescents, but aimed more at prepubescent
minds.	This is a downright embarassment, wherein teenage castaways on a
tropical island become the target of a female mad scientist employed by "the
Enemy" to conduct mind control experiments.  The plot to turn the good guys
into mindless vegetables is foiled, of course, but the calibre of acting talen
makes one wonder.  The bulk of monster antics are supplied by the obligatory
and homicidal lab assistant.  One of the all-time worst, this falls short of
approaching it's own unique form of high art.  You won't quite believe the
stupidity unraveling before your eyes.	Don Sullivan, Katherine Victor, Steve
Conte.

 Thin Air (UK, 1968, aka The Body Stealers) The tepid script condemns
well-made sf/super/spy concoction to mediocrity.  The government agent assigned
to investigate disappearances of key military personnel discovers that they
were abducted by hostile aliens.  Moderately dreary, but quickly forgotten.
Patrick Allen, Lorna Velda, George Saunders, Hillary Dwyer, Maurice Evans, Neil
Connery, Allan Cuthbertson.

 Tower of Terror (UK, 1971) Not much atmosphere, and only a tad more suspense,
a fairly enjoyable psychoshocker/mystery/-suspense yarn.  As two of the most
vital ingredients in the film are left dangling (although continuity appears
intact in all other departments), it seems likely that this film suffered
unwise editing.  A co-ed turns amateur sleuth to avenge the victimization of a
close friend by the rapist-murderer plaguing the campus.  Not up to the level
of most UK thrillers, but a cut above the average American cheapie, it lies
somewhere in between.  Suzy Kendall, Frank Finley, James Laurenson, James
Donald.

 The Twisted Brain (USA, 1974, alternate title, Horror High) Fantastically
predictable but somehow mildly entertaining formula cheapie (due to competent
acting), a downtrodden (and conventionally milquetoast) student is afflicted
with chemically- induced split personality and goes on to wipe out his enemies
while under the influence of his alter ego.  Heavily flawed, but acceptable on
it's own shoddy terms.  Trashy, but for the lenient, amiable.  Pat Cardi, Rose
Holotik, Austin Stoker, John Niland.

 Valley of Gwangi (USA, 1969) The prestigious Ray Harryhausen special effects
can't hide the fact that every cliche in the books is used here, and the story
is a welfare recipient's rehash of King Kong.  This extremely poor combination
monster tale and trite western is recommended only for the most insistent
completist.  A Wild West Show inadvertantly discovers a prehistoric valley.
After the predictable shenanagins take place, a dinosaur is captured,
exhibited, and breaks loose, causing all manner of havoc.  Sound familiar?  In
more ways than one, it is.  Unfortunately, the pathos element that made the
forerunner work is conspicuously absent.  The merit of the visuals can't
salvage the lame, anemic, lacklustre and quite tiresome screenplay.  Really
plastic.  James Franciscus, Gilda Golan, Richard Carlson, Lawrence Naismith,
Curtis Arden.

"Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new
nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are
created equal.

Now we are engaged ina great civil war, testing whether that nation or any
nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on a great bat-
tlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a
final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might
live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a
larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this
ground. The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it
far above our poor power to add or detract.

The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can
never forget what they did here. It is for us the living rather to be dedicated
here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly
advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause
for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly
resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God
shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the
people, for the people shall not perish from the earth."

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for
one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected
them with another, and to assume, among the Powers of the earth,
the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and
of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions
of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which
impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,
it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute
new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing
its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect
their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments
long established should not be changed for light and transient causes;
and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed
to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing
the forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and
usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce
them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw
off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.
--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now
the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.
The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated
injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment
of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Facts
be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary
for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate
and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation
till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended,
he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of
large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish
the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right
inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,
uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their
Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them
into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing
with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions,
to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers,
incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large
for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed
to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States;
for that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners;
refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither,
and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent
to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.

He has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure
of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of
Officers to harass our People, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies
without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of
and superior to the Civil Power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction
foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws;
giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation:

For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders
which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring
Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government,
and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once
an example and fit instrument for introducing the same
absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws,
and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves
invested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection
and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns,
and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries
to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun
with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the
most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas
to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of
their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has
endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers,
the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare,
is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress
in the most humble terms:  Our repeated Petitions have been answered
only by repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked
by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler
of a free People.

Nor have We been wanting in attention to our British brethren.
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their
legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and
settlement here.  We have appealed to their native justice
and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our
common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably
interrupt our connections and correspondence.  They too have been
deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.  We must, therefore,
acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them,
as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America,
in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of
the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name,
and by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies,
solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are,
and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States;
that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,
and that all political connection between them and the State
of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved;
and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to
levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce,
and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may
of right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm
reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge
to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

We the people of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union,
establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence,
promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves
and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the
United States of America.

The food tables and data methods based on "EATER'S CHOICE: PATIENT
GUIDE" are the guidelines of the American Heart Association.
The key to the plan is controlling your intake of the nutrient that
most affects blood cholesterol levels - saturated fat.

Saturated Fat:

Fats contain a mixture of fatty acids - saturated, monosaturated, and
polyunsaturated. Animal fats contain a greater proportion of saturated
fatty acids, which raise blood cholesterol levels; vegetable oils usually
contain a greater proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which lower
blood cholesterol levels. The more saturated the fat, the more solid it is
at room temperature. Examples of saturated fat include beef fat, butter,

Figuring your Daily Allowance of Saturated Fat:

The Heart Association recommends that no more than 10% of your total
calories come from saturated fat.

Translating Your Saturated Fat Quota Into Foods:

Keep track of the foods you eat during the day, along
with their saturated fat calories. Limit your saturated fat intake to the
10% level calculated.

You may want to begin by determining which foods your saturated fat
calories are coming from. You can then decide which foods to cut back on or
eliminate to lower your saturated fat intake. Food tables will also
help you choose foods low in saturated fat to substitute for foods high in
saturated fat.

Controlling Dietary Cholesterol and Other Fats:

Dietary cholesterol can be controlled by simply eliminating the few high
cholesterol foods ( egg yolks, organ meats, sardines, and shrimp).
Substituting polyunsaturated margarines and oils for butter and shortening
will give you adequate polyunsaturated fat.
